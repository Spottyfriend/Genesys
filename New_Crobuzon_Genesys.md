## Introduction

Welcome, reader, to the definitive guide to playing Fantasy Flight's *Genesys* RPG system within the world of Bas-Lag, with a focus on that world's greatest city-state: New Crobuzon.

The world of Bas-Lag was created by fantasy/sci-fi author China Mieville and is the setting of his books: [*Perdido Street Station*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perdido_Street_Station), [*The Scar*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Scar_(novel)), [*Iron Council*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron_Council) and the short story [*Jack*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Looking_for_Jake). It is inhabited by countless races, filled with strange technologies, sciences and magics, and has a history which stretches back thousands of years, from the rise and fall of the Ghosthead Empire, to the 19th century of the First Umbric Age.

What seperates Bas-Lag from other fantasy settings, is its unrelenting insistence on the weird. In the world of D&D, the party may stumble across a hamlet in which the townsfolk have turned to stone and, tally-ho, our adventurers must uncover the origins of this perplexing mystery! In Mieville's world, our adventurers will doubtless have already passed through a forest of frozen lightning, where bears made of dust form and disperse, or fought off a party of violent ex-cleaner constructs, their clockwork analytical engines infected by a sentience-granting virus. In these conditions, a town full of stone-people might hardly be of concern. 

It's not a contradiction to say, however, that Bas-Lag is a world, in many ways, quite close to our own. Great riches are, more often than not, accumulated not by glory, or evil conquest, but by simple exploitation driven by self-interest; Bas-Lag's empires are built up more by industry and racial politics than a diablobical desire to conquer. This is not to say, of course, that there are no villains in Bas-Lag, or heroes, but that those individuals must fit into a world with all the moral liminality of our own.

The intention of this guide is to give the reader *both* an understanding of the world of Bas-Lag, with a heavy focus on the city of New Crobuzon, *and* an understanding of the rules that the RPG system *Genesys* provides in relation to running a campaign in that world: races, careers, skills, talents, items and equipment, vehicles and adversaries.

This guide aims to allow players to run a campaign in New Crobuzon without having read Mieville's books, although groups will be at a definite story-telling advantage if *at least* the GM has read the first of Mieville's Bas-Lag series: *Perdido Street Station*. In view of this, the details of the world of Bas-Lag contained within this guide will be in relation to that world in the years just preceding 1779, which is to say, just preceding *Perdido Street Station*. This guide will therefore be spoiler-free in terms of plot events, although readers will miss out on the joy of discovering the world as Mieville presents it. In any case, spoiler-adverse readers should procede with care.

Nerdier readers also may wish to take note that not all information contained within this guide is strictly *canon*, since, though my primary source is Mieville's books, I also use many of details found in *Dragon* #352. The writer, Bauer, was given access to Meiville's unpublished notebooks, but was also given license to add to Meiville's world, though without changing any of its established facts. Less nerdier readers are free, therefore, to totally disregard this information; it will not affect your experience of play in the slightest.

## Setting

### The City: New Crobuzon

>"The river twists and turns to face the city. It looms suddenly, massive, stamped on the landscape. Its light wells up around the surrounds, the rock hills, like bruise-blood. Its dirty towers glow. I am debased. I am compelled to worship this extraordinary presence that has silted into existence at the conjunction of two rivers. It is a vast pollutant, a stench, a klaxon sounding. Fat chimneys retch dirt into the sky even now in the deep night."

The city of Crobuzon was founded roughly 1,800 years ago as a small village near the coast of lron Bay at the outflow to the Gross Tar river, near where Tarmuth is now. It prospered and quickly became a favorite target of pirate attacks until, 100 years after its founding, one such raid burned Crobuzon to the ground.

The inhabitants pulled up stakes and moved to where the River Tar meets with the Canker, just a few miles upriver from its meeting with
the sea. Although the people renamed it New Crobuzon, the dating system from the first settlement's founding on Iron Bay was retained (Anno Urbis - AU - and retroactively, Before New Crobuzon - BNC). Over time, its exploited citizens and scheming mayors have extended its reach thousands of miles, and have built its manufactories into a vast, sprawling, industrial mess. The city-state has created great art and advanced sciences, funded rail travel and gliding aerostats, destroyed one of its rival cities and brought others to heel, and has made some of its merchants very, very wealthy indeed.

New Crobuzon now suffers the diseases of a proud industrial metropolis: alchemical wastes flow into the Gross Tar from Brock
Marsh; the crowds (three and a half million strong) strain its streets and rails; and while its newer buildings tower ten and even twenty stories high, every mass of concrete, tar, and brick is rotting at the base. Many of its districts are slums; rebels and unions threaten the wealth of the powerful capitalist industrialists; and its citizens are barely held in check by the brutal militia.

Welcome to New Crobuzon, the greatest city-state in the world.

#### Geography

---

*The Wealthier Districts*

Wealth in the city comes in several forms: money, power, knowledge, and influence. All of these can be found in the richest districts, which cluster near the centre and northeast of the city.

**Chnum**: A district of merchants and factory-owners who command redstone manors full of servants and sleep on featherbeds, Chnum is a dull but very pleasant place. Its wide avenues and large houses are always watched both by the militia and by private guards, who protect their employers from everything from kidnapping to beggars.

**The Crow**: this fashionable commercial and shopping district is spread out around Perdido Street Station in a mix of broad streets and tangled alleys. Three main shopping streets - LeTissof Street, Concubek Pass, and Bouleveard Dos Ghérou - radiate out from the station and BilSantum Plaza, at the heart of the district. During the day and early evening, they are always packed with carts, street vendors, buskers, and pedestrians. Many visitors simply take in the sights along the thorough-fares, for all the world seems to bring its wares to the elegant shops to sell: fine tailoring, tropical produce, inlaid snuffboxes, children's golems, gaslight lamps, and feathery lace.

The old noble families that once lived here have long since fled for quieter districts, their homes converted into two- and three-story shops. In the side streets and alleys stand the offices of lawyers and doctors, the dining halls of exclusive gentlement's clubs, actuaries', geothaumaturges', apothecaries', and well-heeled gambling halls. The people here are wealthy and know it, and the only pockets of poverty are those inhabited by those who make their living from the execesses, vices and hobbies of the rich: pickpockets, expensive escorts, fortunetellers and palmists.

**Flag Hill**: A fine district with excellent views and enormous houses that back onto shared, gated gardens, Flag Hill has long been home to bankers and captains of industry. Flowering trees and banyans spill their knotting creepers and make them roots and trunks, emerging from between spotless black paving.

There has been a slum in Flag Hill for years, like an abscess: an oddity of city planning. Mayor Tremulo the Reformer, two centuries past, ordered some streets of modest housing built on the lower slopes of the rise that gave the area its name, so that the heroes of the Pirate Wars, he said, could live by those they had defended. The Flag Hill rich did not welcomed the newcomers and, without money, what had been modest has become a slum. Slate and brick have gone sickly. The little community of Flag Hill poor come in and out by train, while their neighbours disdain the raised rails for private hansoms, and wait for squalor to reach a critical mass.

**Ludmead**: Elegant architecture and the old money that goes with it are only half the story of Ludmead. The other half is the University of New Crobuzon, with its o1d brickwork and large halls surrounding a tree-lined green quadrangle in the heart of the old campus, sitting between Ludmead, Mafaton and Saltbur. The Science Faculty, the Arts Faculty, the Engineering Faculty, the Language Faculty, and the Commerce Faculty all have their own builings, each with a porter who makes sure that vagrants and other undesirables stay out of the classrooms and laboratories. The students are overwhelmingly male and human, but some xenians and women also attend.

Ludmead is also home to Ludmead Station, a well-kept, neatly-tiled station on the Dexter line. A ring of cheap and noisy student taverns surrounds the university, and a good system of streetlights illuminates the area. Walking there at night is quite safe, if occaisonally roudy.

**Mog Hill and Mafaton**: These are largely similar districts; wealthy but otherwise uninteresting. A few of the larger manors have dedicated mooring posts for aerostats or dirigibles.

**Salacus Fields**: A place of fashion and the fashionable, poets and pamphleteers, and the latest breed of junkies. Its residents delight in the scandalous and the outré, and the district is crowded with tea-houses and bars. Clothes here are bright and artistic, and it is a fine place for romance. The artists vary from the wealthiest, with their patrons and lucrative city contracts, to the conventially successful. Many of the artists are xenians working with golem-magic (common among the vodyanoi), or Khepri gland-artists. Its reputation for dissendence and radical artistry is slowly becoming just that at, with richer students and the rebellious sons of businessmen pushing many of the harder radicals into Howl Barrow. Salacus Fields is slowly gentrifying, much to the horror of its older residents.

---

*Ghettoes and Slums*

While every rich district flaunts its wealth in its own special way, poor districts tend to show the same signs of poverty everywhere, although they are still quite distinguishable for natives. The slums are everywhere in the city, from the rotting bricks of Badside to the wreckage of Dog Fenn to the slumping hillside shanties of St. Jabber's Mound - constantly threatening to slide into the next district down whenever a storm washes out the slopes. Echomire can at least boast its docks and Flyside about its militia tower, but the slum-industrial khepri ghetto of Creekside and many others have nothing to recommend them.

**Bonetown**: Named after the Ribs that arch over it so prominently, Bonetown is a shabby place where little good lives. A syncretic mesh of industrialism and cross-bred architecture, urban scrubland, shantytowns, and abandoned docklands line the river shore littered with thick-stemmed weeds. Unbenownst to most, the crimelord Mr Motley keeps his base of operations in Bonetown. The district is joined to Brock Marsh by Danechi's Bridge over the Canker.

**Dog Fenn**: A district of markets selling stolen goods, tired sex workers and (its only truly distinguishing feature) the last operating station on its branch of the rail line. The doors to Dog Fenn Station are rusted open and ticket takers rarely show: the station has been abandoned to poverty, but the trains remain inexplicably reliable. 

Dog Fenn is a hotbed of rebellions and illegal pamphleteering. Many believe *Runagate Rampant*, a dissident newspaper, may be printed here. Pamphleteers press papers into the hands of every passerby in many sections of Dog Fenn, and it is a frequent location of cival unrest of the shouting and rock-throwing kind. Rich visit at their peril; poor folk are rarely molested.

By the time the rivers have flowed through New Crobuzon, their confluence - the Gross Tar - is thick with rubbish, sewage and refuse of all kinds. As a result, a few Dog Fenn river-fishers use nets, weirs and evens dredges to eke a living from this flotsam.

**Howl Barrow**: This small slum is mostly known for its transgressive and oppositional residents: illegal sexualities and taboo gender expressions flourish alongside political radicalism. Many a dissident writer, artist and actor, pushed out of the slowly gentrifying Salicus Fields, live destitute in garrets or in tiny studios at the back of hopeful galleries.

**The Ribs**: Ivory shards of a leviathan, these arching ribs of a fallen giant almost meet about two hundred feet above the ground. The land around them is unlucky; tools break, projects run away into the dust and dirt, nothing propspers. Despite all that, they make a useful landmark to the visitor: just look up, and if you see the ribs, you can orient yourself. The Ribs themselves are a bit of a draw for gawkers, so most residents here are hawkers, buskers, salespeople and acrobats.

**Sheck**: So well-known for anti-xenian unrest that it has its own militia tower, Sheck is technically a step above the slums. It is separated from Kinken by a couple of small parks, and it is the first step out of poverty and into the petty-bourgeois for many. Despite this, Sheck is an area that often supplies funds to the rebellions elsewhere, and many union organisers, journalists and others who disturb the rich and powerful live here, close to their contacts. As such, right-wing reactionaries from Gross Coil, the Crow, and the Glasshouse, as well as organisers from the sinister Three Quills Party, all seem to have friends in Sheck. Xenians rarely visit Sheck any longer than they must.

**Spatters**: At the edge of Rudewood, this slum of desperate shacks is home to the most downtrodden citizens of New Crobuzon, and the city's only garadua ghetto. Unlike other slums, Spatters isn't a collapsed section of city buildings, but a pure shanty town, built shack by shack from refuse and cast-offs.

Fourty years ago, the Sink Line was to be extended. The planners and money-men built the tall shells of residential blocks: not the monoliths of nearby Ketch Heath, but impressive nonetheless. They had opened the railway station, Fell Stop, and had started building another in Rudewood itself, before anything more than a narrow strip around the railway had been cleared. Then the money ran out, and slowly the empty towers were filled by the rural poor of Grain Spiral and the Mendican Foothills. Further shacks appeared, built from stolen materials and inhabited by those city poor who sort a home beyond the grip of parliament and militia.

Poverty is not only downside to the inhabitants of Spatters, however: on occaison, gangs of masked gunmen will appear at night to terrorize and murder. Spatters is also the home of Savage Petter, a feared ganglord fond of impaling his foes and letting them rot in the sun: his name conjures fear well beyond the district's borders.

*Special Districts and Xenian Ghettos*

Some districts have a character all their own, based on the profession or species of the inhabitants. Three of the best-known are the Scientific Quarter of Brock Marsh, the Glasshouse of the city's cactacae, and the khepri's organically reshaped cells and shops. The vodynoi live throughout the city, but always near water of some kind, even if it is just a well or fountain.

**Brock Marsh**: Brock Marsh is a triangu1ar slice of the Old City - low ground wedged between the city's two rivers - the Canker and the Tar - as they meet and become the Gross Tar. Its location near Strack Island - the home of the city's parliament building - makes it important enough to rate a militia tower that anchors a short skyrail over to the island.

Brock Marsh is also called the Scientific Quarter. Some of its denizens are scientists and thinkers, including physicists, chimerist, biophilosophers and teratologists, chymists, necrochymists, mathematicians, karcists and metallurgists, and vodyanoi shaman. If it's an obsure branch of an even more obscure form of knowledge, Brock Marsh is the place to find its practitioners. Its businesses include private libraries, book binders, herbalists, makers of glassware and copper tubing, scale and balance makers, and other artisans who cater to the scientific trade. Small hordes of badgers scamper through the streets, familiars by tradition to the learned, and waddle through special flaps in the store-fronts and doors of these shops.

The favoured locales of the scientific class are pubs. The Dying Child on Umber Promendade is particiularly popular and is run by Silchristcheck, a vodyanoi who rarely leaves his bath. Another favourite is the Moon's Daughters, the common name for the two rocky satelites that orbit the Bas-Lag's moon, which sits near Denachi's Bridge, linking Brock Marsh to Bone Town.

**The Glasshouse**: Built in the middle of Riverskin, this enormous hothouse is home to the majority of the city's cactacae. As its name suggests, it is an entirely enclosed glasshouse. A flattened dome over 70 metres high at its peak and, at its base, more than a quarter of a mile in diameter, the Glasshouse covers several city blocks originally designed for human habitation, the old streets stopping abruptly as they reach a glass wall. The old houses have been adapted for their new, much taller and larger inhabitants: roofs and walls knocked through; tops and backsides of buildings given extra rooms. New structures have been crammed in amongst the old - strange agglomerations of human architecture and monolithic stone-slab edifices stretching in big blocks of variegated colour - some several stories tall. The most imposing is a large red-stone step pyramid that serves a religious function known only to the cactacae, although some sort of sun worship seems likely. The pyramid terraces are overflowing with desert plants, and it is topped with a lensed heliochymical device that generates powerful rays of sunlight.

The glass itself is usually opaque with steam and dirt. The air inside is much warmer and drier than outside, powerful fans regulating temperature and a light source at the peak of the dome heating and brightening the interior. Dune eagles and desert flora live within the glass dome in tended gardens. 

The Glasshouse entrances are always tightly guarded by strong, steady cactacae armed with rivebows and sharp eyes. It is off-limits to
non-cactacae.

**Kinken**: Khepri have lived in New Crobuzon for 700 years, since the first contact with the Bered Kai Nev continent, but they were very few in number unitl the Tragic Crossing. Escaping a unthinkable disaster willingfully forgotten by today's Khepri, the great clockwork  engines of the Mercy Ships carried thousands of dying khepri to the shores the continent of Rohagi. The khepri that arrived in New Crobuzon settled in Kinken. These days, the houses of the khepri district ooze the white mucus of home-grubs. Although called grubs, they are in fact beetles larger than rhinos and they reshape architecture with phlegm-cement to suit khepri standards, their little legs pushing as they eat their way through interiors. Home-grubs obey khepri handers who tug and guide them to make the right renovations, using scent glands and special bridles.

The khepri run Kinken semi-autonomously, though none admit this state of affairs openly. The khepri institutions are nominally just mutual aid societies, each of them answerable to a moiety chief and a hive queen. In fact, these societies are just facades for the moieties or family clans themselves, some of which date back to the earliest days of khepri diaspora. The hive queens control the streets, arrest and punish wrongdoers, proect shopkeepers from anti-xenian assaultm and even levy tributes paid to them in city taxes. The militia visits when it must; lawbreakers harbored in the ghetto are sometimes turned over to the militia after a back-channel request or kept under house arrest within Kinken itself.

Kinken is a step up from the desperately poor khepri homes in Creekside.

*Rail and Industrial Locations*

Business and industry is scattered throughout the city, from the sweatshops of Dog Fenn to the savage industrial wastelands of Echomire and Smog Bend. The best-known working districts are Gross Coil, the docks of Kelltree (and to a lesser extent, Echomire), and the famous rails that meet at Perdido Street Station.

**Arrowhead Mines and Arrowhead House**: Owned by the Penton's industrial concern, in turn owned by the industrialist Josiah Penton, the Arrowhead Mines are miles outside the city proper, but their ore comes to its smelters every day by rail. A private line, carefully defended, runs from the mines to the city's edges, and the whole complex is part of a large commerical cartel, rather shadowy, with connections and holding in heavy industry, thickets of front-men and hollowed-out chartered firms. 

The Pentons were deeply invovled in the creation of torque bombs that destroyed Suroch during the Pirate Wars. They live in the Arrowhead mansion in the Mafaton district, a place said to conceal a literal fortress beneath its glittering facade. Some even say that a secret rail line runs from it to a secure boathouse on the Canker near Banguest Bridge. No proof of this exists, but the story is widely believed.

**Griss Twist**: For every industry, there must be dumping grounds. Griss Twist enjoyed a short-lived boom of small machinofacture decades ago - all noise, smells and profit. But it also became the site of massive riverside dumping - a first clandestine, then open - creating a new landscape of rubble, rubbish and industrial offal, cartloads and bargeloads in steady successions. Today the Griss Twist landscape is one of fenced-in mounds of broken machines, mining slag and organic offal. Hills, valleys and piles sorted by type and lagoons of liquid waste and chymical detritus find their home in Griss Twist. Most of the factories are long gone, but the dumps are eternal, and the winds from Iron Bay sometimes send a choking stench over the Tar into Petty Coil across the river.

A few factories still work at half or quarter-time, sorting, smelting and sifting through the landscape of trash. However, the region is most notable for the growing presence within its dumps. Unbeknowst to all but a small congregation of heretic Godmech Cogs, a conglomarated intelligence of constructs is forming. Born of a slipped mechanism in a discarded engine, the *Construct Council* is a now a thinking network of sentient constructs, with each new assimilated construct growing its analytical power and knowledge of the city. It appears to its congregation as a behemoth of rubbish and decaying engines, but it speaks with a human avatar - a rotting body cabled to the Council and speaking with a strange, quivering voice. Day by day the Council grows, though it's ultimate aims are unknown to even its most devoted acolytes.

**Gross Coil**: This district of soot and fumes is home to booming industry, factory-workers crowding in everyday via the Sink Line. It and Skulkford are sitting on layers of older buildings, which, for hundreds of years, have sunk into the mire. The sewers of Gross Coil therefore meld with ruined houses and warehouses. Where these submerged buildings meet the River Tar, the city's Vodyanoi poor live in squalor.

**Kelltree**: Between Rust Bridge and Barley Bride and served by its own rail spur from the Dexter Line, Kelltree is dominated by its large square docks. The channels are carved deep into the clay here to make new passageways for ships: primitive steamships, enormous sailing ships, and even submersibiles carved from great nautili shells. The district is an important workplace for many of the city's vodyanoi stevedores, who live nearby along the water in Lichford and Gross Coil, and along much of the Tar, but both vodyanoi and human laborers load and unload the cargos that arrive daily.

The true terrain of Kelltree is not land at all however, but the undulating forest of hundreds of ships that anchor here in slips, basins, reservoirs and canals built into the docklands. Cranes and stevedores never stop moving, the masts of tall ships smudge the skyline, and its warehouses are full to bursting. Barges and tugs often take the goods further upriver to Smog Band and Gross Coil, and rails carry them throughout the city.

**Perdido Street Station**: The centre of the city's train lines and skyrails, Perdido Street Station is a hub connecting the militia towers, the major city districts, and the seats of the city's power. Its five enormous openings swallow the five main rail lines, and the buildings include various militia towers and turrets, workshops, torture chambers, shops, taverns and even a small museum.

An industrial castle, bristling with random parapets, Perdido Street Station's westernmost tower is the militia’s headquarters - the Spike - looms over the other turrets, dwarfing them, tugged in seven directions by taut skyrails. For all its height though, the Spike is only an annex of the enormous station. No maps of the station cover it all and its architect is said to have gone mad seven years after the station had been completed - a heretic intent on building his own god.

The city's five main lines are the Dexter, Head, Sink, Sud, and Verso lines, with more than two dozen stations. The Dexter Line includes the Kelltree and Dog Fenn spurs. The Sink Line is abandoned in the section leading into Rude Wood.

**Tarmuth**: Although New Crobuzon itself is about ten miles from the sea, Tarmuth serves it as a port just a few miles to the east. Though not technically within the city itself, Tarmuth is the city's port and is controlled by Parliament and the great merchant houses. Many of the city's gentry and parliamentarians keep summer houses in the countryside nearby or further along the shore of Iron Bay.

---

*Government and State Locations*

**Militia Towers and Skyrails**: Sticking up from the city like huge needles, the two-hundred-and-fifty-foot-tall militia towers contain the iron fist of the city-state's government; in a sense, they are vertical barracks. Most towers are linked by the seven skyrails to the Spike, the westernmost tower at Perdido Street Station and the militia headquarters, allowing swift transport in dangling pods by militiamen and other state officials along the thick, thrumming wires. All towers have aerostats and dirigibles ready to deploy at a moment's notice to put down a rioting crowd or a strike that the bosses can no longer tolerate.

The towers stand in ten locations throughout the city, including Flyside, Strack Island, Sheck, and Bonetown, and the central Spike at Perdido Street Station. Each is manned by at least fifty and up to five-hundred militiamen, though they do not mark themselves with badges or uniforms in public unless absolutley necessary. The top of each tower is an observation platform where telescopes and optics are mounted to spy on the citizenry.

Dissidents are brought to the Spike for judgement in secret courts by the faceless Magisters - judges who operate using false names. Sentencing is harsh and quick, and is usually followed by a whipping, fines or transportation to the punishment factories for Remaking.

**Parliament and Strack Island**: Parliament is a dark edifice, a set of smoky black walls that jut from Strack Island at the confluence of the Canker and the Tar. This building is not simply the home of New Crobuzon's elected body and Mayor's office; it is a sprawling complex of governemnt offices, laboratories, holding cells for high-level political prisoners, and archives of all city records. The living quarters of the Lord Mayor and their ministers are also housed within the parliament complex for times of civil unrest.

The primary section of Parliament is the legislative building itself, home to the constant deliberations, bribery, and brinksmanship that make up New Crobuzoner political life. Numbers vary from session to session as new rules of order are adopted by each parliament to govern the size of the succeeding one, but generally between three-hundred and five-hundred members of Parliament work and live on Strack Island during the height of parliamentary sessions.

The Mayor's office - the Lemquist Room - also sits somewhere within the walls of parliament. Behind the huge, ancient, iron-bound doors, the Lemquist Room is immensely tall, panelled in darkwood of exquisite quality. Portraits of previous mayors circle the room, from the ceiling thirty feet above, spiralling slowly down to within six feet of the floor. An enormous window looks out directly at Perdido Street Station and the Spike.

The island is not open to the public. The submerged base of the building is patrolled by vodyanoi mitilia. The skies above are watched by aerostats. The grounds themselves don't appear heavily armed, but are protected by well-placed sniper towers and a series of underground tunnels where troops can move quickly around the island out of sight.

#### Politics and the State

---

New Crobuzon is a city in a constant state of flux. The uneasy truce between exploited workers and their unfeeling bosses will often explode into strikes and protests, only to be ruthlessly supressed. The state, for its part, maintains the rules of this brutal game, with all its instruments of control positioned to enforce a status quo that places a hard limit on the liberty of the mass of people. In Parliament, New Crobuzon's various parties come to comfortable settlements on tax and subsidies for industry. One thing appears unchanging in New Crobuzon however, and that is the power of the Lord Mayor.

---

*The Lord Mayor*

The Mayor is effectively the head of state in New Crobuzon, although Parliament controls the purse strings, and the home secretary controls much of the civil service. The mayor influences foreign and domestic policy through his control of the militia, and he has the powers of arrest, torture, and Remaking. To ensure the city prospers, he operates primarily through wheedling, deal-making, threatening to use the militia, and enforcement of Parliament’s edicts. He shares responsibility with Parliament for foreign policy, overseas trade, and conducting wars.

While Parliament is responsible for taxation and proposing legislation, it is primarily a check on mayoral power. In good times, the two operate in a sort of symbiotic harmony. In bad times, nothing is too outrageous: fiscal threats, petty vengeances, blackmail, and outright Remakings are sometimes part of the political game in New Crobuzon. A cabinet of six to seventeen lords and ministers – appointed by the Mayor – reports to him and none other. Although the precise configuration varies, most cabinets include a Lord Privy Seal, Minister of Commerce and Industry, Chancellor of the Exchequer, Minister of Justice (including the Junior Minister for Remaking,) Lord Captain of the Militia, Minister of State, and a Minister Without Portfolio.

At present, the Mayor is Bentham Rudgutter. A typical Mayor - Bentham is a member of the Fat Sun party, is extremely well-connected, wealthy, calculating, and utterly ruthless. Whilst some Crobuzoners may accuse him of having grown fat off of the vast power that his position provides, these naysayers are, in a literal sense at least, incorrect; Bentham is tall, muscled and commands the attention of all those in his presence.

---

*Parliament*

Parliament, housed in a huge blackened building on Strack Island, consists of a body of roughly 500 of the richest and most venial public servants in New Crobuzon, and consists entirely of propertied men and women, plus a few vodyanoi and cactacae. The very few xenians who are represented are usually elevated by special mechanisms to ensure “reputable representation,” although they could technically be elected simply on the usual system.

Parliament diligently looks after its own interests during each yearly session. The interests of the working man or woman of New Crobuzon are, for the most part, only worth considering near election time. To vote in the New Crobuzon elections, one must be either a property-owning citizen, or the lucky winner of an electoral lottery, (i.e., the “suffrage lottery.”) The lottery’s purpose is to add the voice of “ordinary people” to the “expertise” of the wealthy. In practice, though, many of those who win such a lottery sell their voting tickets to vote-shapers, who use them as proxies for their own interests.

---

*Political Parties*

Parliament is divided into at least a dozen political parties at any given time, although the ruling party is usually either the Fat Sun or (rarely) Finally We Can See.

**Fat Sun**: The party of industry, trade and all monied interests, the thoroughly corrupt Fat Sun party has reached a height during the government of Mayor Rudgutter. It's supporters can be found amongst all classes in the city, but it's donors and members of Parliment are wealthy and landowning without exception.

**Finally We Can See**: A corrupt, weaselly party best known for joining the government coalition – regardless of the coalition’s makeup. Finally We Can See traditionally makes liberal noises and claims to represent “the honest everyday citizen” but it has rarely done anything to show it.

**Diverse Tendency**: A small party of xenians and a few humans, Diverse Tendency attempts to exploit legitimate xenian fears at the ballot box for its own ends (namely a share of the spoils of government.) While it preaches tolerance, it does little to encourage it. The party sometimes holds the balance of power, but is too small to rule. Thoroughly corrupt, it is nonetheless popular in the xenian ghettos. Xenian radicals view party members as sell-outs.

**Three Quills**: appealing to nativism, jingoism and a violent anti-Xenian sentiment, the Three Quills party is known for proposing pogroms to kill or exile the khepri, cactacae, vodyanoi, and all other non-humans from the city. The party has a significant street presence in some areas in the city, with 'Quillers' committing assaults against Xenians and suspected radicals; breaking strikes that attempt to organise Xenians and humans together.

*Militia*

The militia, New Crobuzon’s military defence and its internal correction agents, only appear in their uniforms, the infamous full-face masks and dark armour, the shields and flintlocks, when they are acting as guards at some hyper-secure location, or at times of great emergency. They wore their colours openly during the Pirate Wars and the Sacramundi Riots, when enemies attacked the city’s order from without or within. Otherwise though, for their day-to-day duties, they rely on their reputation and on their vast network of informers (with colonel-informers for oversight) and plain-clothed officers.

When the militia strike, it is the man drinking cassis in the cafe, the old woman weighed down with bags, the clerk in stiff collar and polished shoes who suddenly reach over their heads and pull hoods from invisible folds in the cloth, who slip enormous flintlocks from hidden holsters and pour into criminal dens. When a cutpurse runs from a shouting victim, it might be a portly man with a bushy moustache who grabs the offender in a punishing necklock and disappears with him or her into the crowd, or a militia tower.

No witness could ever say for sure what the agents had looked like in their civilian guise. And no one would ever see the clerk or the portly man or any of them again, in that part of the city.

In New Crobuzon, policing is done by decentralized fear.

*Courts*

Criminals of all kinds are brought to the Spike for judgement. In secret courts, presided over by the faceless magisters - judges who hide their faces and operate using false names - those found guilty are sentenced to harsh punishments - whippings, fines, or, often, transportation to the punishment factories for Remaking.

As is often stressed by officials, magisters, even the top-rank doges, are citizens; they can be of any class, and come from any district; they work masked for justice’s sake, for the anonymity of justice. Critics point out that if magisters were to show their faces, they might meet harsher punishment on the streets than even they could deal out in the courts. In any case, the courts are among the most feared and respected state institutions in New Crobuzon.

*Punishment Factories*

Dotted across the city, above and below ground, the punishment factories of New Crobuzon are considered by many to be the cruelest instruments of New Crobuzon's state machine. 

For a vast array of crimes, individuals are sentenced by a magister to a Remaking; the form of this Remaking often will supposedly hold some poetic justice, such as a thief receiving grotesquely mutilated hands. Other remakings are for the benefit of the state alone, such as melding an inmate with construction equipment for the purpose of hard manual labor. In any case, no one comes out of a punishment factory untouched by the nightmarish process.

Employed in the factories are a small army of highly trained biothaumaturges, experts in the art of tearing at and recreating flesh, bonding it in unintended ways, manipulating it within the limits dictated only by the mind of the thaumaturge themself. Of course, the techniques can heal and repair, but that is not their function here.

#### Religion

---

The pantheons, cults, and religious sects of New Crobuzon are almost as diverse as the Crobuzoners themselves, and many traditions have flourished, diminished, and seen resurgences over the city's long history; some major theologies have perisisted in the city, however.

A note for readers here: Mieville does not go into extensive detail on the majority of the panetheons of New Crobuzon. Presented below is all the detail that is provided within the books; GMs are of course free expand on the following descriptions in any direction they see fit.

*'The Gods'*

The most established religion in New Crobuzon is the church of, what many Crobozeners would simply call, 'the gods' (or 'human gods', as opposed to those worshipped by xenian cultures). Whilst not a diety himself, the most famous, and most worshipped, idol of the church is Saint Jabber, whose very name is imbedded in city and in its dialect. One can hardly step onto the street without hearing the exclamation of 'Jabber's arse!' or 'for Jabber's sake!", not to mention the fact you may be stepping on a street in Jabber's Mound. Many children in New Crobuzon will enjoy a toffee-pudding on Jabber's Feast, or walk the latern-lined streets, jostled by singing crowds at the festival of Jabber's Morning.

The god Darioch is another of New Crobuzon's most popular dieties. He is a key figure in the well-known fables - the *Crawfoot Chronicles*; the New Crobuzoner navy has named several ships after him; and many Crobuzoner's will know the prayer of Darioch's Lament. The Daughter's of Darioch are a nun-like order of women who forgoe worldly pleasures for the worship of Darioch and Jabber.

Other gods of New Crobuzon's most established religion include Solenton, Crawfoot (who's jesting and misadventures are documented in the well-known *Crawfoot Chronicles*), and Salter.

*Khepri Gods*

Awesome Broodma is a central figure of worship for the Khepri of New Crobuzon, as, to a lesser extent, are the Artspitter, Nurse, Air Harvester, Elyctric Devil, Wingsister (whose worshippers take to the rooftops and pray for flight) and the guard-gods the Tough Sisters, one with crossbow and flintlock, another with spear and hooknet, and the third with a metaclockwork stingbox. Strange to even the latter, rarer sects though, are those who pledge themselves to Insect Aspect.

Properly transliterated from Khepri into the New Crobuzon script, the chymico-audio-visual composite of description, devotion and awe that is the name of the god is rendered Insect/Aspect/ (male)/(singleminded). It is taught that (what is usually translated as) 'Insect Aspect' is the lord of all creation, the all-powerful force that knows only hunger and thirst and rutting and satisfaction. He shat out the universe after eating the void, in a mindless act of cosmic creation the purer and more brilliant for being devoid of motive or awareness.

The bleak doctrine of Insect Aspect is that khepri women are cursed. Some vile flaw on the part of the first woman had consigned her daughters to lives encumbered with slow, floundering bipedal bodies and minds possessed by useless consciousness. Woman had lost the insectile purity of God and male. Worshippers of Insect Aspect, therefore, worship the mindless male khepri and seek to live as they do - without complex thought beyond eating and pleasureless sex.

*Palgolak Church*

The Palgolak church is popular in New Crobuzon, even for non-believers, partly due to its immense library, which houses at least as many tomes as the library of New Crobuzon University. If one knows anything about the diety and his followers, it is easy to see why this is what the church is primarily known for. Palgolak is a god of knowledge. He is depicted either as a fat, squat human reading in a bath, or a slender vodyanoi doing the same, or, mystically, both at once. His congregation are human and vodyanoi in roughly equal proportions. He is an amiable, pleasant deity, a sage whose existence is entirely devoted to the collection, categorization, and dissemination of information.

The Palgolaki are proselytizers, holding that everything known by a worshipper is immediately known by Palgolak, which is why they are religiously charged to read voraciously. But their mission is only secondarily for the glory of Palgolak, and primarily for the glory of knowledge, which is why they are sworn to admit all who wish to enter into their library.

The New Crobuzon Palgolak Library has the best collection of religious manuscripts known in the world of Bas-Lag, and it therefore attracts pilgrims from a huge variety of religious traditions and factions. They throng the northern ends of Brock Marsh and Spit Hearth, all the worshipping races of the Bas-Lag, in robes and masks, sporting whips, leashes, magnifying glasses, the whole gamut of religious paraphernalia.

*Godmech Cogs and One True God*

The followers of One True God are the Godmech Cogs, believers in a mechanised, construct-like cosmos. Worshippers may be found across the city, with interlocking wheels tattooed across their arms, attempting to convert those unfortunate enough to have decided to engage a Cog in casual conversation. Despite their reputation for heated theological debate however, the Godmech Cogs are egalitarian and, even at their worst, mostly harmless.

---

*Codling Brood*

The viciously anti-xenian Codling Brood is growing in the city. Their theologies lead them to a violent human supremacy which have some associating with the Three Quills party; it would not be unsuprising to find a member of the Brood patrolling some moonlit poorer district with a Quiller gang, out to "keep their city clean".

---

*Church of the Clock Gods*

The religion of the clock gods is one more closely associated with the humans living in Shankell (the city that lies on the southern coastline of the Meagre Sea). Churches can be found in New Crobuzon though, with the ululating hymn to Sanshad, the sun god, able to be heard belted through their windows. A newer religion in the city, the teachings of the clock gods only found their way over the Meagre Sea some thirty years ago, but, since then, many of the sublties and nuances of the theology has been lost. Worshippers in New Crobuzon, however, have a certain rowdy zeal that their cousins in Shankell lack.

---

*Manifold Horizon*

Very few if any temples to the Manifold Horizon exist in New Crobuzon, and only a handful of believers may be found, at most. Worship in the tradition of the Manifold Horizon is split into its various Moments. The Moments of the Manifold Horizon are as diverse as they are numerous: Cadmer, Moment of Calculation; Zaori, Moment of Magic Wine; Pharru, Moment of Forgotten Snow; Tekke Shesim, Moment of Memory; Tekke Vogu; Moment of the Hidden and Lost; Moment of Doves; Moment of Desiccation. Monks fully dedicated to such moments may learn thaumaturgic abilities associated with each. A monk of Tekke Vogu, for example, is utterly enfolded in the Moment, giving them the power to uncover a hidden truth in exchange for something forcably and painfully hidden from them about their self, their past, or even parts of their physical bodies; their dedicate also leaves them totally unseen. Monks of Zaori, on the other hand, may experience visions upon drinking certain liquids. Those monks dedicated to the Moment of Desiccation possess the power to turn blood to ash, among other abilities.

The Manifold Horizon is primarily a Teshi religion, so any worshippers to have successfully arived in New Crobuzon will have come very far indeed, since Tesh lies on the far South West side of the contient from New Crobuzon.

*Non-Belief*

Given the vast quantity and variety of traditions and pantheons in the city, one would be forgiven for believing that New Crobuzon's inhabitants were, on the whole, deeply religious. In truth, this is often far from the case. It is true that most believe, justifiably, in the existence of other aspects of reality – they can, after all, be communicated with, and even visited. Alternate planes may indeed be inhabited by beings and essences with immense power, in human terms at least, but, says the non-believer, taking the leap to call these beings “gods” is unncessary, and worshipping them would be close to pointless.
