## Introduction

Welcome, reader, to the definitive guide for playing Fantasy Flight's *Genesys* RPG system within the world of Bas-Lag, with a focus on that world's greatest city-state: New Crobuzon.

The world of Bas-Lag was created by fantasy/sci-fi author China Mieville and is the setting of his books: [*Perdido Street Station*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perdido_Street_Station), [*The Scar*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Scar_(novel)), [*Iron Council*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron_Council) and the short story [*Jack*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Looking_for_Jake). It is inhabited by countless races, filled with strange technologies, sciences and magics, and has a history which stretches back thousands of years, from the rise and fall of the Ghosthead Empire, to the 19th century of the First Umbric Age.

What seperates Bas-Lag from other fantasy settings, is its unrelenting insistence on the weird. In the world of D&D, the party may stumble across a hamlet in which the townsfolk have turned to stone and, tally-ho, our adventurers must uncover the origins of this perplexing mystery! In Mieville's world, our adventurers will doubtless have already passed through a forest of frozen lightning, where bears made of dust form and disperse, or fought off a party of violent ex-cleaner constructs, their clockwork analytical engines infected by a virus. In these conditions, a town full of stone-people might hardly be of concern. 

It's not a contradiction to say, however, that Bas-Lag is a world, in many ways, quite close to our own. Great riches are, more often than not, accumulated not by glory, or evil conquest, but by simple exploitation driven by self-interest; Bas-Lag's empires are built up more by industry and racial politics than a diablobical desire to conquer. This is not to say, of course, that there are no villains in Bas-Lag, or heroes, but that those individuals must fit into a world with all the moral liminality of our own.

The intention of this guide is to give the reader *both* an understanding of the world of Bas-Lag, with a heavy focus on the city of New Crobuzon, *and* an understanding of the rules that the RPG system *Genesys* provides in relation to running a campaign in that world: races, careers, skills, talents, items and equipment, vehicles and adversaries.

This guide aims to allow players to run a campaign in New Crobuzon without having read Mieville's books, although groups will be at a definite story-telling advantage if *at least* the GM has read *Perdido Street Station*. In view of this, the details of the world of Bas-Lag contained within this guide will be in relation to that world in the years just preceding 1779, which is to say, just preceding *Perdido Street Station*. This guide will therefore be spoiler-free in terms of events, although readers will miss out on the joy of discovering the world as Mieville presents it. In any case, spoiler-adverse readers should procede with care.
