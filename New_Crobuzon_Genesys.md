## Introduction

Welcome, reader, to the definitive guide to playing Fantasy Flight's *Genesys* RPG system within the world of Bas-Lag, with a focus on that world's greatest city-state: New Crobuzon.

The world of Bas-Lag was created by fantasy/sci-fi author China Mieville and is the setting of his books: [*Perdido Street Station*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perdido_Street_Station), [*The Scar*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Scar_(novel)), [*Iron Council*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron_Council) and the short story [*Jack*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Looking_for_Jake). It is inhabited by countless races, filled with strange technologies, sciences and magics, and has a history which stretches back thousands of years, from the rise and fall of the Ghosthead Empire, to the 19th century of the First Umbric Age.

What seperates Bas-Lag from other fantasy settings, is its unrelenting insistence on the weird. In the world of D&D, the party may stumble across a hamlet in which the townsfolk have turned to stone and, tally-ho, our adventurers must uncover the origins of this perplexing mystery! In Mieville's world, our adventurers will doubtless have already passed through a forest of frozen lightning, where bears made of dust form and disperse, or fought off a party of violent ex-cleaner constructs, their clockwork analytical engines infected by a virus. In these conditions, a town full of stone-people might hardly be of concern. 

It's not a contradiction to say, however, that Bas-Lag is a world, in many ways, quite close to our own. Great riches are, more often than not, accumulated not by glory, or evil conquest, but by simple exploitation driven by self-interest; Bas-Lag's empires are built up more by industry and racial politics than a diablobical desire to conquer. This is not to say, of course, that there are no villains in Bas-Lag, or heroes, but that those individuals must fit into a world with all the moral liminality of our own.

The intention of this guide is to give the reader *both* an understanding of the world of Bas-Lag, with a heavy focus on the city of New Crobuzon, *and* an understanding of the rules that the RPG system *Genesys* provides in relation to running a campaign in that world: races, careers, skills, talents, items and equipment, vehicles and adversaries.

This guide aims to allow players to run a campaign in New Crobuzon without having read Mieville's books, although groups will be at a definite story-telling advantage if *at least* the GM has read the first of Mieville's Bas-Lag series: *Perdido Street Station*. In view of this, the details of the world of Bas-Lag contained within this guide will be in relation to that world in the years just preceding 1779, which is to say, just preceding *Perdido Street Station*. This guide will therefore be spoiler-free in terms of events, although readers will miss out on the joy of discovering the world as Mieville presents it. In any case, spoiler-adverse readers should procede with care.

## Setting

### The City: New Crobuzon

---

*"The river twists and turns to face the city. It looms suddenly, massive, stamped on the landscape. Its light wells up around the surrounds, the rock hills, like bruise-blood. Its dirty towers glow. I am debased. I am compelled to worship this extraordinary presence that has silted into existence at the conjunction of two rivers. It is a vast pollutant, a stench, a klaxon sounding. Fat chimneys retch dirt into the sky even now in the deep night."* - *Perdido Street Station*

---

The city of Crobuzon was founded roughly 1,800 years ago as a small village near the coast of lron Bay at the outflow to the Gross Tar river, near where Tarmuth is now. It prospered and quickly became a favorite target of pirate attacks until, 100 years after its founding, one such raid burned Crobuzon to the ground.

The inhabitants pulled up stakes and moved to where the River Tar meets with the Canker, just a few miles upriver from its meeting with
the sea. Although the people renamed it New Crobuzon, the dating system from the first settlement's founding on Iron Bay was retained (Anno Urbis / Before New Crobuzon). Over time, its exploited citizens and hard-scheming mayors have extended its reach thousands of miles, and have built its manufactories into a vast, sprawling, industrial mess. The city-state has created great art and advanced sciences, funded rail travel and gliding aerostats, destroyed one of its rival cities and brought others to heel, and has made some of its merchants very, very wealthy indeed.

New Crobuzon now suffers the diseases of a proud industrial metropolis: alchemical wastes flow into the Gross Tar from Brock
Marsh; the crowds (three and a half million strong) strain its streets and rails; and while its newer buildings tower ten and even twenty stories high, every mass of concrete, tar, and brick is rotting at the base. Many of its districts are slums; rebels and unions threaten the wealth of the powerful capitalist industrialists; and its citizens are barely held in cheek by the brutal militia.

Wekome to New Crobuzon, the greatest city-state of the world.

#### Geography

##### The Wealthier Districts

Wealth in the city comes in several forms: money, power, knowledge, and influence. All of these can be found in the richest districts, which cluster near the centre and northeast of the city.

**Chnum**: A district of merchants and factory-owners who command redstone manors full of servants and sleep on featherbeds, Chnum is a dull but very pleasant place. Its wide avenues and large houses are always watched both by the militia and by private guards, who protect their employers from everything from kidnapping to beggars.

**The Crow**: this fashionable commercial and shopping district is spread out around Perdido Street Station in a mix of broad streets and tangled alleys, Three main shopping streets-LeTissof Street, Concubek Pass, and Bouleveard Does Ghérou - radiate out from the station and BilSantum Plaza, at the heart of the district. During the day and early evening, they are always packed with carts, street vendors, buskers, and pedestrians. Many of them simply take in the sights along the thorough-fares, for all the world seems to bring its wares to the elegant shops to sell: fine tailoring, tropical produce, inlaid snuffboxes, children's golems, gaslight lamps, and feathery lace.

Old noble families that once lived here have long since fleed for. quieter districts, their homes converted to two- and three-story shops. In the side streets and alleys stand the offices of lawyers and doctors, the dining halls of exclusive gentlement's clubs, actuaries', geothaumaturges', apothecaries', and well-heeled gambling halls. The people here are welathy and know it, and the only pockets of poverty are those inhabited by those who make their living from the execesses, vices and hobbies of the rich: pickpockets, expensive escorts, fortunetellers and palmists.

**Flag Hill**: A fine district with excellent views and enormous houses that back onto shared, gated gardens, Flag Hill has long been home to bankers and captains of industry. Flowering trees and banyans spill their knotting creepers and make them roots and trunks, emerging from between spotless black paving.

There has been a slum in Flag Hill for years, like an abscess: an oddity of city planning. Mayor Tremulo the Reformer, two centuries past, ordered some streets of modest housing built on the lower slopes of the rise that gave the area its name, so that the heroes of the Pirate Wars, he said, could live by those they had defended. The Flag Hill rich did not welcomed the newcomers, and without money what had been modest has become a slum. Slate and brick have gone sickly. The little community of Flag Hill poor come in and out by train, while their neighbours disdain the raised rails for private hansoms, and wait for squalor to reach a critical mass.

**Ludmead**: Elegant architecture and the old money that goes with it are only half the story of Ludmead. The other half is the University of New Crobuzon, with its o1d brickwork and large halls surrounding a tree-lined green quadrangle in the heart of the old campus, sitting between Ludmead, Mafaton and Saltbur. The Science Faculty, the Arts Faculty, the Engineering Faculty, the Language Faculty, and the Commerce Faculty all have their own builings, each with a porter who makes sure that vagrants and others stay out of the classrooms and laboratories. The students are overwhelmingly male and human, but some xenians and women also attend.

Ludmead is also home to Ludmead Station,a well-kept, neatly-tiled station on the Dexter line. A ring of cheap and noisy student taverns surrounds the university, and a good system of streetlights illuminates the area. Walking there at night is quite safe, if occaisonally roudy.

**Mog Hill and Mafaton**: These are largely similar districts; wealthy but otherwise uninteresting. A few of the larger manors have dedicated mooring posts for aerostats or dirigibles.

**Salacus Fields**: A place of fashion and the fashionable, poets and pamphleteers, and the latest breed of junkies. Its residents delight in the scandalous and the outré, and the district is crowded with tea-houses and bars. Clothes here are bright and artistic, and it is a fine place for romance. The artists vary from the wealthiest, with their patrons and lucrative city contracts, to the conventially successful. Many of the artists are xenians working with golem-magic (common among the vodyanoi), or Khepri gland-artists. Its reputation for dissendence and radical artistry is slowly becoming just that at, with richer students and the rebellious sons of businessmen pushing many of the harder radicals into Howl Barrow. Salacus Fields is gentrifying, much to the horror of its older residents.

##### Ghettoes and Slums

While every rich district flaunts its wealth in its own special way, poor districts tend to show the same signs of poverty everywhere, although they are still quite distinguishable for natives. The slums are everywhere in the city, from the rotting bricks of Badside to the wreckage of Dog Fenn to the slumping hillside shanties of St. Jabber's Mound - constantly threatening to slide into the next district down whenever a storm washes out the slopes. Echomire can at least boast its docks and Flyside about its militia tower, but the slum-industrial khepri ghetto of Creekside and many others have nothing to recommend them.

**Bonetown**: Named after the Ribs that arch over it so prominently, Bonetown is a shabby place where little good lives. A syncretic mesh of industrialism and cross-bred architecture, urban scrubland, shantytowns, and abandoned docklands line the river shore littered with thick-stemmed weeds. Unbenownst to most, the crimelord Mr Motley keeps his base of operations in Bonetown. The district is joined to Brock Marsh by Danechi's Bridge over the Canker.

**Dog Fenn**: A district of markets selling stolen goods, tired sex workers and (its only truly distinguishing feature) the last operating station on its branch of the rail line. The doors to Dog Fenn Station are rusted open and ticket takers rarely show: the station has been abandoned to poverty, but the trains remain inexplicably reliable. 

Dog Fenn is a hotbed of rebellions and illegal pamphleteering. Many believe *Runagate Rampant*, a dissident newspaper, may be printed here. Pamphleteers press papers into the hands of every passerby in many sections of Dog Fenn, and it is a frequent location of cival unrest of the shouting and rock-throwing kind. Rich visit at their peril; poor folk are rarely molested.

By the time the rivers have flowed through New Crobuzon, their confluence - the Gross Tar - is thick with rubbish, sewage and refuse of all kinds. As a result, a few Dog Fenn river-fishers use nets, weirs and evens dredges to eke a living from this flotsam.

**Howl Barrow**: This small slum is mostly known for its transgressive and oppositional residents: illegal sexualities and taboo gender expressions flourish alongside political radicalism. Many a dissedent writer, artist and actor, pushed out of the slowly gentrifying Salicus Fields, live destitute in garrets or in tiny studios at the back of hopeful galleries.

**The Ribs**: Ivory shards of a leviathan, these arching ribs of a fallen giant almost meet about two hundred feet above the ground. The land around them is unlucky; tools break, projects run away into the dust and dirt, nothing propspers. Despite all that, they make a useful landmark to the visitor: just look up, and if you see the ribs, you can orient yourself. The Ribs themselves are a bit of a draw for gawkers, so most residents here are hawkers, buskers, salespeople and acrobats.

**Sheck**: so well-known for anti-xenian unrest that it has its own militia tower, Sheck is technically a step above the slums. It is separated from Kinken by a couple of small parks, and it is the first step out of poverty and into the petty-bourgeois for many. Despite this, Sheck is an area that often supplies funds to the rebellions elsewhere, and many union organisers, journalists and others who disturb the rich and powerful live here, close to their contacts. As such, right-wing reactionaries from Gross Coil, the Crow, and the Glasshouse, as well as organisers from the sinister Three Quills Party, all seem to have friends in Sheck. Xenians rarely visit Sheck any longer than they must.

**Spatters**: At the edge of Rudewood, this slum of desperate shacks is home to the most downtrodden citizens of New Crobuzon, and the city's only garadua ghetto. Unlike other slums, Spatters isn't a collapsed section of city buildings, but a pure shanty town, built shack by shack from refuse and cast-offs.

Fourty years ago, the Sink Line was to be extended. The planners and money-men built the tall shells of residential blocks: not the monoliths of nearby Ketch Heath, but impressive nonetheless. They had opened the railway station, Fell Stop, and had started building another in Rudewood itself, before anything more than a narrow strip around the railway had been cleared. Then the money ran out, and slowly the empty towers were filled by the rural poor of Grain Spiral and the Mendican Foothills. Further shacks appeared, built from stolen materials and inhabited by those city poor who sort a home beyond the grip of parliament and militia. Poverty is not only downside to the inhabitants of Spatters, however: on occaison, gangs of masked gunmen will appear at night to terrorize and murder. Spatters is also the home of Savage Petter, a feared ganglord fond of impaling his foes and letting them rot in the sun: his name conjures fear well beyond the district's borders.
