## Introduction

Welcome, reader, to the definitive guide to playing Fantasy Flight's *Genesys* RPG system within the world of Bas-Lag, with a focus on that world's greatest city-state: New Crobuzon.

The world of Bas-Lag was created by fantasy/sci-fi author China Mieville and is the setting of his books: [*Perdido Street Station*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perdido_Street_Station), [*The Scar*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Scar_(novel)), [*Iron Council*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron_Council) and the short story [*Jack*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Looking_for_Jake). It is inhabited by countless races, filled with strange technologies, sciences and magics, and has a history which stretches back thousands of years, from the rise and fall of the Ghosthead Empire, to the 19th century of the First Umbric Age.

What seperates Bas-Lag from other fantasy settings, is its unrelenting insistence on the weird. In the world of D&D, the party may stumble across a hamlet in which the townsfolk have turned to stone and, tally-ho, our adventurers must uncover the origins of this perplexing mystery! In Mieville's world, our adventurers will doubtless have already passed through a forest of frozen lightning, where bears made of flies form and disperse, or fought off a party of violent ex-cleaner constructs, their clockwork analytical engines infected by a sentience-granting virus. In these conditions, a town full of stone-people might hardly be of concern. 

It's not a contradiction to say, however, that Bas-Lag is a world, in many ways, quite close to our own. Great riches are, more often than not, accumulated not by glory, or evil conquest, but by simple exploitation driven by self-interest; Bas-Lag's empires are built up more by industry and racial politics than a diablobical desire to conquer. This is not to say, of course, that there are no villains in Bas-Lag, or heroes, but that those individuals must fit into a world with all the moral liminality of our own.

The intention of this guide is to give the reader *both* an understanding of the world of Bas-Lag, with a heavy focus on the city of New Crobuzon, *and* an understanding of the rules that the RPG system *Genesys* provides in relation to running a campaign in that world: races, careers, skills, talents, items and equipment, vehicles and adversaries.

This guide aims to allow players to run a campaign in New Crobuzon without having read Mieville's books, although groups will be at a definite story-telling advantage if *at least* the GM has read the first of Mieville's Bas-Lag series: *Perdido Street Station*. In view of this, the details of the world of Bas-Lag contained within this guide will be in relation to that world in the years just preceding 1779, which is to say, just preceding *Perdido Street Station*. This guide will therefore be spoiler-free in terms of plot events, although readers will miss out on the joy of discovering the world as Mieville presents it. In any case, spoiler-adverse readers should procede with care.

Nerdier readers also may wish to take note that not all information contained within this guide is strictly *canon*, since, though my primary source is Mieville's books, I also use some of details found in *Dragon* #352. The writer, Bauer, was given access to Meiville's unpublished notebooks, but was also given license to add to Meiville's world, though without changing any of its established facts. This guide, however, avoids the more significant details introduced by *Dragon*, such as more explicit descriptions the Ghosthead Empire, and of other towns and cities on Rohagi. Less nerdier readers are free to totally disregard this information; it will not affect your experience of play in the slightest.

## Setting

### The City: New Crobuzon

>"The river twists and turns to face the city. It looms suddenly, massive, stamped on the landscape. Its light wells up around the surrounds, the rock hills, like bruise-blood. Its dirty towers glow. I am debased. I am compelled to worship this extraordinary presence that has silted into existence at the conjunction of two rivers. It is a vast pollutant, a stench, a klaxon sounding. Fat chimneys retch dirt into the sky even now in the deep night."

The city of Crobuzon was founded roughly 1,800 years ago as a small village near the coast of lron Bay at the outflow to the Gross Tar river, near where Tarmuth is now. It prospered and quickly became a favorite target of pirate attacks until, 100 years after its founding, one such raid burned Crobuzon to the ground.

The inhabitants pulled up stakes and moved to where the River Tar meets with the Canker, just a few miles upriver from its meeting with the sea. Although the people renamed it New Crobuzon, the dating system from the first settlement's founding on Iron Bay was retained (Anno Urbis - AU - and retroactively, Before New Crobuzon - BNC). Over time, its exploited citizens and scheming mayors have extended its reach thousands of miles, and have built its manufactories into a vast, sprawling, industrial mess. The city-state has created great art and advanced sciences, funded rail travel and gliding aerostats, destroyed one of its rival cities and brought others to heel, and has made some of its merchants very, very wealthy indeed.

New Crobuzon now suffers the diseases of a proud industrial metropolis: thick pollutants flow into the Gross Tar from Brock Marsh; the crowds (some three million strong) strain its streets and rails; and while its newer buildings tower ten and even twenty stories high, every mass of concrete, tar, and brick is rotting at the base. Many of its districts are slums; rebels and unions threaten the wealth of the powerful capitalist industrialists; and its citizens are barely held in check by the brutal militia.

Welcome to New Crobuzon, the greatest city-state in the world.

#### Geography

![Map of the City from Perdido Street Station](https://i.imgur.com/EQWNk8M.png)

A brief note for readers: although the section below gives a summary of most of the districts and boroughs of New Crobuzon, some (Dryside, Pincod, Sunter, and others) are absent. This is because, simply, the books do not give descriptions of every district. GMs are therefore free to insert their own ideas as to what these locations might be like - their peoples, landmarks, industries - and indeed to expand on the following summaries in anyway they wish. 

---

*Wealthier Districts*

Wealth in the city comes in several forms: money, power, knowledge, and influence. All of these can be found in the richest districts, which cluster near the centre and northeast of the city.

**Chnum**: A district of merchants and factory-owners who command redstone manors full of servants and sleep on featherbeds, Chnum is a dull but very pleasant place. Its wide avenues and large houses are always watched both by the militia and by private guards, who protect their employers from everything from kidnapping to beggars.

**The Crow**: This fashionable commercial and shopping district is spread out around Perdido Street Station in a mix of broad streets and tangled alleys. Three main shopping streets - LeTissof Street, Concubek Pass, and Bouleveard Dos Ghérou - radiate out from the station and BilSantum Plaza, at the heart of the district. During the day and early evening, they are always packed with carts, street vendors, buskers, and pedestrians. Many visitors simply take in the sights along the thorough-fares, for all the world seems to bring its wares to the elegant shops to sell: fine tailoring, tropical produce, inlaid snuffboxes, children's golems, gaslight lamps, and feathery lace.

The old noble families that once lived here have long since fled for quieter districts, their homes converted into two- and three-story shops. In the side streets and alleys stand the offices of lawyers and doctors, the dining halls of exclusive gentlement's clubs, actuaries', geothaumaturges', apothecaries', and well-heeled gambling halls. The people here are wealthy and know it, and the only pockets of poverty are those inhabited by the citizens who make their living from the execesses, vices and hobbies of the rich: pickpockets, expensive escorts, fortunetellers and palmists.

**East Gidd and Nigh Sump**: Austere, baroque buildings line the streets of these districts. They are certainly designed for the richer of the city's families, but it is unclear where the children play - the streets are mostly quiet and empty.

**Flag Hill**: A fine district with excellent views and enormous houses that back onto shared, gated gardens, Flag Hill has long been home to bankers and captains of industry. Flowering trees and banyans spill their knotting creepers and make them roots and trunks, emerging from between spotless black paving.

There has been a slum in Flag Hill for years, like an abscess: an oddity of city planning. Mayor Tremulo the Reformer, two centuries past, ordered some streets of modest housing built on the lower slopes of the rise that gave the area its name, so that the heroes of the Pirate Wars, he said, could live by those they had defended. The Flag Hill rich did not welcomed the newcomers and, without money, what had been modest has become a slum. Slate and brick have gone sickly. The little community of Flag Hill poor come in and out by train, while their neighbours disdain the raised rails for private hansoms, and wait for squalor to reach a critical mass.

**Ludmead**: Elegant architecture and the old money that goes with it are only half the story of Ludmead. The other half is the University of New Crobuzon, with its o1d brickwork and large halls surrounding a tree-lined green quadrangle in the heart of the old campus, sitting between Ludmead, Mafaton and Saltbur. The Science Faculty, the Arts Faculty, the Engineering Faculty, the Language Faculty, and the Commerce Faculty all have their own builings, each with a porter who makes sure that vagrants and other undesirables stay out of the classrooms and laboratories. The students are overwhelmingly male and human, but some xenians and women also attend.

Ludmead is also home to Ludmead Station, a well-kept, neatly-tiled station on the Dexter line. A ring of cheap and noisy student taverns surrounds the university, and a good system of streetlights illuminates the area. Walking there at night is quite safe, if occaisonally roudy.

**Mog Hill and Mafaton**: These are largely similar districts; wealthy but otherwise uninteresting. A few of the larger manors have dedicated mooring posts for aerostats or dirigibles.

**Rim**: A prosperous neighbourhood, Rim is defined by its wide streets and stuccoed houses, though today there are some crumbling blocks behind the grand facades. Residents might find pleasure by rowing on the Canker, an activity that is only possible on the section of the river here - west of the strange chymical and thaumaturgic wastes deposited by the businesses of Brock Marsh.

---

*Middle Class Districts*

**Barrackham**: Once a much richer district, Barrackham is now faded, and the money has mostly gone elsewhere. There are still grand estates, but compared to the luxury of Flag Hill and Mafaton, the suburbia of Barrackham is shabby, and the bricks of its manors are cracked and peeling.

**Canker Wedge**: Less than two miles from the centre of the city, Canker Wedge is a different world. Low, quiet streets and modest housing, small apologetic parks, frumpy churches and halls, offices with false fronts and façades in a cacophony of muted styles; stunted oaks and darkwoods hide the architecture’s failings. On days off, residents of Canker Wedge can be found visiting its zoo or rowing the waters of the Canker for pleasure, an unthinkable pastime further south.

**Gallmarch and Serpolet**: Gallmarch and Serpolet are middle-class suburbs. Far from the city's centre, they are quiet and dull, and their residents walk the streets mostly unmolested.

**Pelorus Fields**: A 'respectable' district, the Three Quills Party might find some of its richer supporters here.

**Salacus Fields**: A place of fashion and the fashionable, poets and pamphleteers, and the latest breed of junkies. Its residents delight in the scandalous and the outré, and the district is crowded with tea-houses and bars. Clothes here are bright and artistic, and it is a fine place for romance. The artists vary from the wealthiest, with their patrons and lucrative city contracts, to the conventially successful. Many of the artists are xenians working with golem-magic (common among the vodyanoi), or khepri gland-artists. Its reputation for dissendence and radical artistry is slowly becoming just that at, with richer students and the rebellious sons of businessmen pushing many of the harder radicals into Howl Barrow. Salacus Fields is slowly gentrifying, much to the horror of its older residents.

**Spit Hearth**: A relatively upmarket district, Spit Hearth is the home to three booming 'industries'.

Between the Crow and Spit Hearth, there is an upmarket redlight district, for those with particular and particularly depraved taste. Whilst cheap, quick sex is easily bought in Dog Fenn, the city's more central hub is home to more exotic, horrific and expensive pleasures - Remade designed for sex work, races from foreign lands possessing particularly fetishised anatomies.

Where the borough meets the river, subterranean punishment factories emit wails of pain, sometimes, and hastily smothered screams. But for the sake of its public face, Spit Hearth is able to ignore that hidden economy with only a slight show of distaste.

For centuries, alongside the most depraved aspects of the city, Spit Hearth has been a haven for dissenting churches and religious societies. Its walls are held together with the paste from a thousand mouldering posters advertising theological debates and discussions. The monks and nuns of peculiar contemplative sects walk the streets hurriedly, avoiding eye contact. Dervishes and hieronomers argue on corners.

---
*Poor Districts and Slums*

While every rich district flaunts its wealth in its own special way, poor districts tend to show the same signs of poverty everywhere, although they are still quite distinguishable for natives. The slums are everywhere in the city, from the rotting bricks of Badside to the wreckage of Dog Fenn to the slumping hillside shanties of St. Jabber's Mound - constantly threatening to slide into the next district down whenever a storm washes out the slopes. Echomire can at least boast its docks and Flyside its militia tower, but the mean, poor streets of Murkside, Raven's Gate, Stoneshell, Chimer and others have nothing to recommend them.

**Aspic**: A busy, lively district, Aspic is filled with all of the city's races and peoples. Its residents are the poor, but pockets of more middle-class and even rich individuals can be found. Whilst rubbish is often piled on street corners, much of Aspic is pleasant and leafy, with bayan-fringed thoroughfares running through it. It's most notable feature is Aspic Bazaar - a vast open-air market that sells everything from trinkets and clothes, to drugs, pets, and fortune-tellings. The rows upon rows of merchandise converge upon the centre of the bazaar like the spokes of a vast wheel. Scams and pickpockets run rampant: *let the buyer beware*.

**Badside**: Hovels and slum houses crowd Badside - rotting brick-mulch sinks down into the earth. There was once an attempt to replicate the Kelltree docks in Badside, but all that remains now is three massive stinking troughs of malarial slime, their surfaces broken with half-sunk wrecks and twisted girders.

**Bonetown**: Named after the Ribs that arch over it so prominently, Bonetown is a shabby place where little good lives. A syncretic mesh of industrialism and cross-bred architecture, urban scrubland, shantytowns, and abandoned docklands line the river shore littered with thick-stemmed weeds. Unbenownst to most, the crimelord Mr Motley keeps his base of operations in Bonetown. The district is joined to Brock Marsh by Danechi's Bridge over the Canker.

**Dog Fenn**: A district of markets selling stolen goods, tired sex workers and (its only truly distinguishing feature) the last operating station on its branch of the rail line. The doors to Dog Fenn Station are rusted open and ticket takers rarely show: the station has been abandoned to poverty, but the trains remain inexplicably reliable. 

Dog Fenn is a hotbed of rebellions and illegal pamphleteering. Many believe *Runagate Rampant*, a dissident newspaper, may be printed here. Pamphleteers press papers into the hands of every passerby in many sections of Dog Fenn, and it is a frequent location of cival unrest of the shouting and rock-throwing kind. Rich visit at their peril; poor folk are rarely molested.

By the time the rivers have flowed through New Crobuzon, their confluence - the Gross Tar - is thick with rubbish, sewage and refuse of all kinds. As a result, a few Dog Fenn river-fishers use nets, weirs and evens dredges to eke a living from this flotsam.

**Flyside**:	Cheap and not too violent, crowded, mostly good-natured, Flyside is a mixed area, with a large human majority beside small colonies of vodyanoi by the quiet canal, a few solitary outcast cactacae, even a little two-street khepri hive, a rare traditional community outside of Kinken and Creekside. 

**Howl Barrow**: This small slum is mostly known for its transgressive and oppositional residents: illegal sexualities and taboo gender expressions flourish alongside political radicalism. Many a dissident writer, artist and actor, pushed out of the slowly gentrifying Salicus Fields, live destitute in garrets or in tiny studios at the back of hopeful galleries.

**Ketch Heath**: The most notable feature of Ketch Heath is its huge tower blocks - some of the tallest buildings in the city. Though poor, the district has a certain beauty, with its monoliths reaching into the sky alongside ancient rue conifer pines.

**Lichford**: Another of the city's poor districts, it is filled with shacks and, by the river, vodyanoi slums.

**Petty Coil**: -	A little over a hundred years previously, Petty Coil had been an urban hub for the major families. The Mackie-Drendas and the Turgisadys; Dhrachshachet, the vodyanoi financier and founder of the Drach Bank; Sirrah Jeremile Carr, the merchant-farmer: all had their great houses in Petty Coil’s wide streets. But industry had exploded in New Crobuzon, much of it bankrolled by those very families. Factories and docks budded and proliferated. This was short-lived. Griss Twist became a dump and the winds that blew in from the sea could send a pestilential stench over the Tar into Petty Coil.

The rich have now long deserted their homes, and Petty Coil has degenerated in a lively fashion. It has become noisier. The massive houses have become homes for more and more of New Crobuzon’s swelling population. Windows have broken, been fixed roughly, and broken again. As more small food-shops and bakers and carpenters moved in, Petty Coil has fallen willing prey to the city’s ineluctable capacity for spontaneous architecture.

**The Ribs**: Ivory shards of a leviathan, these arching ribs of a fallen giant almost meet about two hundred feet above the ground. The land around them is unlucky; tools break, projects run away into the dust and dirt, nothing propspers. Despite all that, they make a useful landmark to the visitor: just look up, and if you see the ribs, you can orient yourself. The Ribs themselves are a bit of a draw for gawkers, so most residents here are hawkers, buskers, salespeople and acrobats.

**Sheck**: So well-known for anti-xenian unrest that it has its own militia tower, Sheck is technically a step above the slums. It is separated from Kinken by a couple of small parks, and it is the first step out of poverty and into the petty-bourgeois for many. As such, reactionaries from Gross Coil, the Crow, and the Glasshouse, as well as organisers from the sinister Three Quills Party, all seem to have friends in Sheck. Xenians rarely visit Sheck any longer than they must.

**Sobek Croix**: A district known for its large and pretty gardens, Sobek Croix is nevertheless poor, and its dilapidated slate housing leans tiredly on the impressive trees of its gardens.

**Spatters**: At the edge of Rudewood, this slum of desperate shacks is home to the most downtrodden citizens of New Crobuzon, and the city's only garadua ghetto. Unlike other slums, Spatters isn't a collapsed section of city buildings, but a pure shanty town, built shack by shack from refuse and cast-offs.

Fourty years ago, the Sink Line was to be extended. The planners and money-men built the tall shells of residential blocks: not the monoliths of nearby Ketch Heath, but impressive nonetheless. They had opened the railway station, Fell Stop, and had started building another in Rudewood itself, before anything more than a narrow strip around the railway had been cleared. Then the money ran out, and slowly the empty towers were filled by the rural poor of Grain Spiral and the Mendican Foothills. Further shacks appeared, built from stolen materials and inhabited by those city poor who sort a home beyond the grip of parliament and militia.

Poverty is not only downside to the inhabitants of Spatters, however: on occaison, gangs of masked gunmen will appear at night to terrorize and murder. Spatters is also the home of Savage Petter, a feared ganglord fond of impaling his foes and letting them rot in the sun: his name conjures fear well beyond the district's borders.

*Special Districts and Xenian Ghettos*

Some districts have a character all their own, based on the profession or species of the inhabitants. Three of the best-known are the Scientific Quarter of Brock Marsh, the Glasshouse of the city's cactacae, and the khepri's organically reshaped cells and shops. The vodynoi live throughout the city, but always near water of some kind, even if it is just a well or fountain.

**Brock Marsh**: Brock Marsh is a triangluar slice of the Old City - low ground wedged between the city's two rivers - the Canker and the Tar - as they meet and become the Gross Tar. Its location near Strack Island - the home of the city's parliament building - makes it important enough to rate a militia tower that anchors a short skyrail over to the island.

Brock Marsh is also called the Scientific Quarter. Some of its denizens are scientists and thinkers, including physicists, chimerist, biophilosophers and teratologists, chymists, necrochymists, mathematicians, karcists and metallurgists, and vodyanoi shaman. If it's an obsure branch of an even more obscure form of knowledge, Brock Marsh is the place to find its practitioners. Its businesses include private libraries, book binders, herbalists, makers of glassware and copper tubing, scale and balance makers, and other artisans who cater to the scientific trade. Small hordes of badgers scamper through the streets, familiars by tradition to the learned, and waddle through special flaps in the store-fronts and doors of these shops.

The favoured locales of the scientific class are pubs. Run by Silchristcheck, a surly vodyanoi who rarely leaves his bath - The Dying Child on Umber Promendade is particiularly popular. Another favourite is the Moon's Daughters (the common name for the two rocky satelites that orbit the Bas-Lag's moon), which sits near Denachi's Bridge, linking Brock Marsh to Bone Town.

**Creekside**: A hundred years ago, Creekside was a tumbledown slum for humans. Today, it is a rookery of found architecture, khepri home-grubs doing little more than encasing the ruined houses with cement, petrifying them forever on the point of collapse over and over again. The khepri denizens of Creekside are not artists or fruitbar owners, moiety chiefs or hive elders or shopkeepers. They are disreputable and hungry. They work in the factories and in the sewers, sell themselves to whomever would buy. Their sisters in Kinken despise them.

**Riverskin and The Glasshouse**: Built in the middle of Riverskin, the enormous hothouse that is the Glasshouse is home to many of the city's cactacae. As its name suggests, it is an entirely enclosed glasshouse. A flattened dome over 70 metres high at its peak and, at its base, more than a quarter of a mile in diameter, the Glasshouse covers several city blocks originally designed for human habitation, the streets inside stopping abruptly as they reach a glass wall. The old houses have been adapted for their new, much taller and larger inhabitants: roofs and walls knocked through; tops and backsides of buildings given extra rooms. New structures have been crammed in amongst the old - strange agglomerations of human architecture and monolithic stone-slab edifices stretching in big blocks of variegated colour - some several stories tall. The most imposing is a large red-stone step pyramid that serves a religious function known only to the cactacae, although some sort of sun worship seems likely. The pyramid terraces are overflowing with desert plants, and it is topped with a lensed heliochymical device that generates powerful rays of sunlight.

The glass itself is usually opaque with steam and dirt. The air inside is much warmer and drier than outside, powerful fans regulating temperature and a light source at the peak of the dome heating and brightening the interior. Dune eagles and desert flora live within the glass dome in tended gardens. 

The Glasshouse entrances are always tightly guarded by strong, steady cactacae armed with rivebows and sharp eyes. It is off-limits to non-cactacae.

The streets of Riverskin incline gently upwards towards the Glasshouse. The houses are old and tall, with rotting wooden frames and walls of damp plaster. In the summer, every rain saturates and blisters them, sending slates cascading from the steep roofs as rusted nails dissolve. The southern half of Riverskin is indistinguishable from Flyside, which it adjoins, but northern Riverskin is very different. It is quieter, more sullen. Cactae pack the Riverskin slums, and a few other quarters in places like Syriac and Abrogate Green. But Riverskin is the centre of their city, and there they mix in equal numbers with human locals. They are the cactus underclass, who enter the Glasshouse to shop and worship, but are forced to live in the infidel city.

**Kinken**: Khepri have lived in New Crobuzon for 700 years, since the first contact with the Bered Kai Nev continent, but they were very few in number unitl the Tragic Crossing. Escaping a unthinkable disaster willingfully forgotten by today's khepri, the great clockwork engines of the Mercy Ships carried thousands of dying khepri to the shores of the continent of Rohagi. The khepri that arrived in New Crobuzon settled in Kinken.

Today, the houses of the khepri district ooze the white mucus of home-grubs. Although called grubs, they are in fact beetles larger than rhinos; they reshape architecture with phlegm-cement to suit khepri standards, their little legs pushing as they eat their way through interiors. Home-grubs obey khepri handlers who tug and guide them to make the right renovations, using scent glands and special bridles.

The khepri run Kinken semi-autonomously, though none admit this state of affairs openly. The khepri institutions are nominally just mutual aid societies, each of them answerable to a moiety chief and a hive queen. In fact, these societies are just facades for the moieties or family clans themselves, some of which date back to the earliest days of khepri diaspora. The hive queens control the streets, arrest and punish wrongdoers, protect shopkeepers from anti-xenian assault and even levy tributes paid to them in city taxes. The militia visits when it must; lawbreakers harbored in the ghetto are sometimes turned over to the militia after a back-channel request or kept under house arrest within Kinken itself.

Kinken is a step up from the desperately poor khepri homes in Creekside.

*Rail and Industrial Locations*

Business and industry is scattered throughout the city, from the sweatshops of Dog Fenn to the savage industrial wastelands of Echomire and Smog Bend. The best-known working districts are Gross Coil, the docks of Kelltree (and to a lesser extent, Echomire), and the famous rails that meet at Perdido Street Station.

**Arrowhead Mines and Arrowhead House**: Owned by the Penton's industrial concern, in turn owned by the industrialist Josiah Penton, the Arrowhead Mines are miles outside the city proper, but their ore comes to its smelters every day by rail. A private line, carefully defended, runs from the mines to the city's edges, and the whole complex is part of a large commerical cartel, rather shadowy, with connections and holding in heavy industry, thickets of front-men and hollowed-out chartered firms. 

The Pentons were deeply invovled in the creation of Torque bombs that destroyed Suroch during the Pirate Wars. They live in the Arrowhead mansion in the Mafaton district, a place said to conceal a literal fortress beneath its glittering facade. Some even say that a secret rail line runs from it to a secure boathouse on the Canker near Banguest Bridge. No proof of this exists, but the story is widely believed.

**Echomire**: Second to Kelltree in its docks, Echomire is gouged by fat square docks and reservoirs, huge culs-de-sacs of water that jut into the city, linked by deep channels to the river, thronging with ships. It is a savage, industrial zone.

**Griss Twist**: For every industry, there must be dumping grounds. Griss Twist enjoyed a short-lived boom of small machinofacture decades ago - all noise, smells and profit. But it also became the site of massive riverside dumping - a first clandestine, then open - creating a new landscape of rubble, rubbish and industrial offal, cartloads and bargeloads in steady successions. Today the Griss Twist landscape is one of fenced-in mounds of broken machines, mining slag and organic offal. Hills, valleys and piles sorted by type and lagoons of liquid waste and chymical detritus find their home in Griss Twist. Most of the factories are long gone, but the dumps are eternal, and the winds from Iron Bay sometimes send a choking stench over the Tar into Petty Coil across the river.

A few factories still work at half or quarter-time, sorting, smelting and sifting through the landscape of trash. However, the region is most notable for the growing presence within its dumps. Unbeknowst to all but a small congregation of heretic Godmech Cogs, a conglomarated intelligence of constructs is forming. Born of a slipped mechanism in a discarded engine, the *Construct Council* is a now a thinking network of sentient constructs, with each new assimilated construct growing its analytical power and knowledge of the city. It appears to its congregation as a behemoth of rubbish and decaying engines, but it speaks with a human avatar - a rotting body cabled to the Council and speaking with a strange, quivering voice. Day by day the Council grows, though it's ultimate aims are unknown to even its most devoted acolytes.

**Gross Coil**: This district of soot and fumes is home to booming industry, the better-paid factory-workers in the city crowding in everyday via the Sink Line. It and Skulkford are sitting on layers of older buildings, which, for hundreds of years, have sunk into the mire. The sewers of Gross Coil therefore meld with ruined houses and warehouses; the once-human undergangs wage subterranean border-wars. Where these submerged buildings meet the River Tar, the city's Vodyanoi poor live in squalor.

**Kelltree**: Between Rust Bridge and Barley Bride and served by its own rail spur from the Dexter Line, Kelltree is dominated by its large square docks. The channels are carved deep into the clay here to make new passageways for ships: primitive steamships, enormous sailing ships, and even submersibiles carved from great nautili shells. The district is an important workplace for many of the city's vodyanoi stevedores, who live nearby along the water in Lichford and Gross Coil, and along much of the Tar, but both vodyanoi and human laborers load and unload the cargos that arrive daily.

The true terrain of Kelltree is not land at all however, but the undulating forest of hundreds of ships that anchor here in slips, basins, reservoirs and canals built into the docklands. Cranes and stevedores never stop moving, the masts of tall ships smudge the skyline, and its warehouses are full to bursting. Barges and tugs often take the goods further upriver to Smog Bend and Gross Coil, and rails carry them throughout the city.

**Perdido Street Station**: The centre of the city's train lines and skyrails, Perdido Street Station is a hub connecting the militia towers, the major city districts, and the seats of the city's power. Its five enormous openings swallow the five main rail lines, and the buildings include various militia towers and turrets, workshops, torture chambers, shops, taverns and even a small museum.

An industrial castle, bristling with random parapets, Perdido Street Station's westernmost tower is the militia’s headquarters - the Spike - looms over the other turrets, dwarfing them, tugged in seven directions by taut skyrails. For all its height though, the Spike is only an annex of the enormous station. No maps of the station cover it all and its architect is said to have gone mad seven years after the station had been completed - a heretic intent on building his own god.

The city's five main lines are the Dexter, Head, Sink, Sud, and Verso lines, with more than two dozen stations. The Dexter Line includes the Kelltree and Dog Fenn spurs. The Sink Line is abandoned in the section leading into Rude Wood.

**Tarmuth**: Although New Crobuzon itself is about ten miles from the sea, Tarmuth serves it as a port just a few miles to the east. Though not technically within the city itself, Tarmuth is the city's port and is controlled by Parliament and the great merchant houses. Many of the city's gentry and parliamentarians keep summer houses in the countryside nearby or further along the shore of Iron Bay.

*Government and State Locations*

**Militia Towers and Skyrails**: Sticking up from the city like huge needles, the two-hundred-and-fifty-foot-tall militia towers contain the iron fist of the city-state's government; in a sense, they are vertical barracks. Most towers are linked by the seven skyrails to the Spike, the westernmost tower at Perdido Street Station and the militia headquarters, allowing swift transport in dangling pods by militiamen and other state officials along the thick, thrumming wires. All towers have aerostats and dirigibles ready to deploy at a moment's notice to put down a rioting crowd or a strike that the bosses can no longer tolerate.

The towers stand in ten locations throughout the city, including Flyside, Strack Island, Sheck, and Bonetown, and the central Spike at Perdido Street Station. Each is manned by at least fifty and up to five-hundred militiamen, though they do not mark themselves with badges or uniforms in public unless absolutley necessary. The top of each tower is an observation platform where telescopes and optics are mounted to spy on the citizenry.

Dissidents are brought to the Spike for judgement in secret courts by the faceless Magisters - judges who operate using false names. Sentencing is harsh and quick, and is usually followed by a whipping, fines or transportation to the punishment factories for Remaking.

**Parliament and Strack Island**: Parliament is a dark edifice, a set of smoky black walls that jut from Strack Island at the confluence of the Canker and the Tar. This building is not simply the home of New Crobuzon's elected body and Mayor's office; it is a sprawling complex of governemnt offices, laboratories, holding cells for high-level political prisoners, and archives of all city records. The living quarters of the Lord Mayor and their ministers are also housed within the parliament complex for times of civil unrest.

The primary section of Parliament is the legislative building itself, home to the constant deliberations, bribery, and brinksmanship that make up New Crobuzoner political life. Numbers of representatives vary from session to session as new rules of order are adopted by each parliament to govern the size of the succeeding one, but generally between three-hundred and five-hundred members of Parliament work and live on Strack Island during the height of parliamentary sessions.

The Mayor's office - the Lemquist Room - also sits somewhere within the walls of parliament. Behind the huge, ancient, iron-bound doors, the Lemquist Room is immensely tall, panelled in darkwood of exquisite quality. Portraits of previous mayors circle the room, from the ceiling thirty feet above, spiralling slowly down to within six feet of the floor. An enormous window looks out directly at Perdido Street Station and the Spike.

The island is not open to the public. The submerged base of the building is patrolled by vodyanoi mitilia. The skies above are watched by aerostats. The grounds themselves don't appear heavily armed, but are protected by well-placed sniper towers and a series of underground tunnels where troops can move quickly around the island out of sight.

#### Politics and the State

---

New Crobuzon is a city in a constant state of flux. The uneasy truce between exploited workers and their unfeeling bosses will often explode into strikes and protests, only to be ruthlessly supressed. The state, for its part, maintains the rules of this brutal game, with all its instruments of control positioned to enforce a status quo that places a hard limit on the liberty of the mass of people. In Parliament, New Crobuzon's various parties come to comfortable settlements on tax and subsidies for industry. One thing appears unchanging in New Crobuzon however, and that is the power of the Lord Mayor.

---

*The Lord Mayor*

The Mayor is effectively the head of state in New Crobuzon, although Parliament controls the purse strings, and the home secretary controls much of the civil service. The mayor influences foreign and domestic policy through his control of the militia, and he has the powers of arrest, torture, and Remaking. To ensure the city prospers, he operates primarily through wheedling, deal-making, threatening the use of militia, and enforcement of Parliament’s edicts. He shares responsibility with Parliament for foreign policy, overseas trade, and conducting wars.

While Parliament is responsible for taxation and proposing legislation, it is primarily a check on mayoral power. In good times, the two operate in a sort of symbiotic harmony. In bad times, nothing is too outrageous: fiscal threats, petty vengeances, blackmail, and outright Remakings are sometimes part of the political game in New Crobuzon. A cabinet of six to seventeen lords and ministers – appointed by the Mayor – reports to him and none other. Although the precise configuration varies, most cabinets include a Lord Privy Seal, Minister of Commerce and Industry, Chancellor of the Exchequer, Minister of Justice (including the Junior Minister for Remaking,) Lord Captain of the Militia, Minister of State, and a Minister Without Portfolio.

At present, the Mayor is Bentham Rudgutter. A typical Mayor - Bentham is a member of the Fat Sun party, is extremely well-connected, wealthy, calculating, and utterly ruthless. Whilst some Crobuzoners may accuse him of having grown fat off of the vast power that his position provides, these naysayers are, in a literal sense at least, incorrect; Bentham is tall, muscled and commands the attention of all those in his presence.

---

*Parliament*

Parliament, housed in a huge blackened building on Strack Island, consists of a body of roughly 500 of the richest and most venial public servants in New Crobuzon; they are entirely propertied men and women, plus a few vodyanoi and cactacae. The very few xenians who are represented are usually elevated by special mechanisms to ensure “reputable representation,” although they could technically be elected simply on the usual system.

Parliament diligently looks after its own interests during each yearly session. The interests of the working man or woman of New Crobuzon are, for the most part, only worth considering near election time. To vote in the New Crobuzon elections, one must be either a property-owning citizen, or the lucky winner of an electoral lottery, (i.e., the “suffrage lottery”). The lottery’s purpose is to add the voice of “ordinary people” to the “expertise” of the wealthy. In practice, though, many of those who win such a lottery sell their voting tickets to vote-shapers, who use them as proxies for their own interests.

---

*Political Parties*

Parliament is divided into at least a dozen political parties at any given time, although the ruling party is usually either the Fat Sun or (rarely) Finally We Can See.

**Fat Sun**: The party of industry, trade and all monied interests, the thoroughly corrupt Fat Sun party has reached a new height during the government of Mayor Rudgutter. It's supporters can be found amongst all classes in the city, but it's donors and members of Parliment are wealthy and landowning without exception.

**Finally We Can See**: A corrupt, weaselly party best known for joining the government coalition, regardless of the coalition’s makeup. Finally We Can See traditionally makes liberal noises and claims to represent “the honest everyday citizen” but it has rarely done anything to show it.

**Diverse Tendency**: A small party of xenians and a few humans, Diverse Tendency attempts to exploit legitimate xenian fears at the ballot box for its own ends (namely a share of the spoils of government.) While it preaches tolerance, it does little to encourage it. The party sometimes holds the balance of power, but is too small to rule. Thoroughly corrupt, it is nonetheless popular in the xenian ghettos. Xenian radicals view party members as sell-outs.

**Three Quills**: appealing to nativism, jingoism and a violent anti-xenian sentiment, the Three Quills party is known for proposing pogroms to kill or exile the khepri, cactacae, vodyanoi, and all other non-humans from the city. The party has a significant street presence in some areas in the city, with 'Quillers' committing assaults against xenians and suspected radicals; breaking strikes that attempt to organise xenians and humans together.

---

*Militia*

The militia, New Crobuzon’s military defence and its internal correction agents, only appear in their uniforms - the infamous full-face masks and dark armour, the shields and flintlocks - when they are acting as guards at some hyper-secure location, or at times of great emergency. They wore their colours openly during the Pirate Wars and the Sacramundi Riots, when enemies attacked the city’s order from without or within, but otherwise, for their day-to-day duties, they rely on their reputation and on their vast network of informers and plain-clothed officers.

When the militia strike, it is the man drinking cassis in the cafe, the old woman weighed down with bags, the clerk in stiff collar and polished shoes who suddenly reach over their heads and pull hoods from invisible folds in the cloth, who slip enormous flintlocks from hidden holsters and pour into criminal dens. When a cutpurse runs from a shouting victim, it might be a portly man with a bushy moustache who grabs the offender in a punishing necklock and disappears with him into the crowd.

No witness could ever say for sure what the agents had looked like in their civilian guise. And no one ever sees the clerk or the portly man or any of them again, in that part of the city.

In New Crobuzon, policing is done by decentralized fear.

---

*Courts*

Criminals of all kinds are brought to the Spike for judgement. In secret courts, presided over by the faceless magisters - judges who hide their faces and operate using false names - those found guilty are sentenced to harsh punishments - whippings, fines, or, often, transportation to the punishment factories for Remaking.

As is often stressed by officials, magisters, even the top-rank doges, are citizens: they can be of any class, and come from any district; they work masked for justice’s sake, for the anonymity of justice. Critics point out that if magisters were to show their faces, they might meet harsher punishment on the streets than even they could deal out in the courts. In any case, the courts are among the most feared and respected state institutions in New Crobuzon.

---

*Punishment Factories*

Dotted across the city, above and below ground, the punishment factories of New Crobuzon are considered by many to be the cruelest instruments of New Crobuzon's state machine. 

For a vast array of crimes, individuals are sentenced by a magister to a Remaking; the form of this Remaking often will supposedly hold some poetic justice, such as a thief receiving grotesquely mutilated hands. Other remakings are for the benefit of the state alone, such as melding an inmate with construction equipment for the purpose of hard manual labor. In any case, no one comes out of a punishment factory untouched by the nightmarish process.

Employed in the factories are a small army of highly trained biothaumaturges - experts in the art of tearing at and recreating flesh, bonding it in unintended ways, manipulating it within the limits dictated only by the mind of the thaumaturge themself. Of course, the techniques can heal and repair, but that is not their function here.

---

#### Groups and Organisations

---

As with any city of its size, New Crobuzon is home to many varied communities, groups and organisations - legal and illegal; virtuous and devious; radical and reactionary. Most New Crobuzoners will have had a run-in with at least one organised interest in the city, that is if they themselves are not involved directly - selling drugs for a gang, writing for an illicit news-sheet, or informing for the militia.

---

*Adventurers*

Some of the toughest individuals in all Bas-Lag, one will often find adventurers stopping in New Crobuzon for supplies, to cash-in a reward, or even to complete a task in their never-ending quest for gold and experience. Often seen in rare armours and with thaumaturgically enchanced weaponry, adventurers are hardy and dangerous; they are generally lawless, stripped of allegiance or morality, living off their wits, stealing and killing, and hiring themselves out to whoever and whatever comes along. 

They are considered by many in New Crobuzon as scum, who live short, violent lives and meet even more violent ends. They hang on to a certain cachet among some more impressionable souls however, through their undeniable bravery and their occasionally impressive exploits.

---

*Criminal Gangs*

New Crobuzon is a criminal city. The type of crime varies, of course, from rich to poor, and from district to district, but crime in the Bas-Lag's greatest city-state is pervasive. Whilst those with most power in the city are those who occupy legal (though often no less exploitative) positions, the criminal gangs and their bosses hold significant sway in the city, particulary in poorer districts.

The crimelord Mr Motley operates out of Bonetown, but his power and influence extends all across the city. His work is the drug trade, primarily, but he does not limit himself; where there is illicit profit to be made, Motley will make sure the largest cut is his. Many who work for him do not know it, and even fewer have seen him. Those who have find him... difficult to describe.

Though Motely holds a monopoly in many criminal markets, the khepri Ma Francine is extending her reach out from Kinken. Her Sugardrop Gang will soon find themselves at violent odds with employees of Mr Motely.

---

*Militia*

Even more pervasive than the city's criminal elements, is the ever-present spectre of New Crobuzon's secret police force - the militia. For more details on the city's half standing army, half intelligence organisation, see the appropriate section in [Politics and the State](#politics-and-the-state).

---

*Three Quillers*

Members of the Three Quills Party are committed to a party program of violent anti-xenian sentiment, nationalism and reaction. As such, Three Quillers will often be found in gangs, roaming poorer districts and xenian ghettos after dark, attacking xenian businesses and residents. Not all Quillers are simply thugs however; there are organisers, thinkers and leaders. Building a movement for race-purity takes careful work: there are xenian/human strikes to break, pamphlets of party literature to write and distribute; and human-only social programs to maintain. 

---

*Radicals*

New Crobuzon's political radicals take various forms, but perhaps the most noteworthy formation are those readers and producers of the illegal news-sheet *Runagate Rampant*. In one sense, the paper is not dissimmilar the *Quarrel*, or the *Beacon*, or any of the city's reputable papers - news, arts and industry are all covered inside - what seperates *Double-R*, as it is known by many, is that takes an explicitly seditionist position on the political questions of the day. 

*RR*'s position is never totally static, since its writers and readers maintain a close eye on the ever-changing goings-on in the factories and the streets as well as in parliament, but a typical issue of *Runagate Rampant* might denounce all parties and call for the spoiling of ballots and for the building of a party from below - a party of the poor and of the workers.

Unlike New Crobuzon's legal press, *Double-R* (as well as its smaller cousins and sometimes rivals *The Shout*, *Forge* and others) is a tool for radical organising. Readers might be seen in after-work drinking sessions, discreetly pointing out an article to a sympathetic co-worker, or attending picket lines with a copy or two tucked under their coat. Reports of strikes, crimes of the state, and planned Quiller actions, whilst absent in *Quarrel*, are all reported in *RR*, providing readers with the knowledge to undertake collective action where necessary. The writers of *RR* will admit, however, that the paper's influence is not as great as some might like to think, though it is surely growing.

The production of the paper takes place in a hidden subterranean office in Dog Fenn. Few but the founding editor of *RR* Benjamin Flex, in whose wardrobe the secret door to the office is located, and a select few writers of the news-sheet, are aware of its location.

---

#### Religion

---

The pantheons, cults, and religious sects of New Crobuzon are almost as diverse as the Crobuzoners themselves, and many traditions have flourished, diminished, and seen resurgences over the city's long history; some major theologies have perisisted in the city, however.

A note for readers here: Mieville does not go into extensive detail on the majority of the panetheons of New Crobuzon. Presented below is all the detail that is provided within the books; GMs are of course free expand on the following descriptions in any direction they see fit.

---

*'The Gods'*

The most established religion in New Crobuzon is the church of, what many Crobozeners would simply call, 'the gods' (or 'human gods', as opposed to those worshipped by xenian cultures). Whilst not a diety himself, the most famous, and most worshipped, idol of the church is Saint Jabber, whose very name is imbedded in city and in its dialect. One can hardly step onto the street without hearing the exclamation of 'Jabber's arse!' or 'for Jabber's sake!", not to mention the fact you may be stepping on a street in Jabber's Mound. Many children in New Crobuzon will enjoy a toffee-pudding on Jabber's Feast, or walk the lantern-lined streets, jostled by singing crowds at the festival of Jabber's Morning.

The god Darioch is another of New Crobuzon's most popular dieties. He is a key figure in the well-known fables - the *Crawfoot Chronicles*; the New Crobuzoner navy has named several ships after him; and many Crobuzoner's will know the prayer of Darioch's Lament. The Daughter's of Darioch are a nun-like order of women who forgoe worldly pleasures for the worship of Darioch and Jabber.

Other gods of New Crobuzon's most established religion include Solenton, Crawfoot (who's jesting and misadventures are documented in the well-known *Crawfoot Chronicles*), and Salter.

---

*Khepri Gods*

Awesome Broodma is a central figure of worship for the khepri of New Crobuzon, as, to a lesser extent, are the Artspitter, Nurse, Air Harvester, Elyctric Devil, Wingsister (whose worshippers take to the rooftops and pray for flight) and the guard-gods the Tough Sisters, one with crossbow and flintlock, another with spear and hooknet, and the third with a metaclockwork stingbox. Strange to even the latter, rarer sects though, are those who pledge themselves to Insect Aspect.

Properly transliterated from khepri into the New Crobuzon script, the chymico-audio-visual composite of description, devotion and awe that is the name of the god is rendered Insect/Aspect/ (male)/(singleminded). It is taught that (what is usually translated as) 'Insect Aspect' is the lord of all creation, the all-powerful force that knows only hunger and thirst and rutting and satisfaction. He shat out the universe after eating the void, in a mindless act of cosmic creation the purer and more brilliant for being devoid of motive or awareness.

The bleak doctrine of Insect Aspect is that khepri women are cursed. Some vile flaw on the part of the first woman had consigned her daughters to lives encumbered with slow, floundering bipedal bodies and minds possessed by useless consciousness. Woman had lost the insectile purity of God and male. Worshippers of Insect Aspect, therefore, worship the mindless male khepri and seek to live as they do - without complex thought beyond eating and pleasureless sex.

---

*Palgolak Church*

The Palgolak church is popular in New Crobuzon, even for non-believers, partly due to its immense library, which houses at least as many tomes as the library of New Crobuzon University. If one knows anything about the diety and his followers, it is easy to see why this is what the church is primarily known for. Palgolak is a god of knowledge. He is depicted either as a fat, squat human reading in a bath, or a slender vodyanoi doing the same, or, mystically, both at once. His congregation are human and vodyanoi in roughly equal proportions. He is an amiable, pleasant deity, a sage whose existence is entirely devoted to the collection, categorization, and dissemination of information.

The Palgolaki are proselytizers, holding that everything known by a worshipper is immediately known by Palgolak, which is why they are religiously charged to read voraciously. But their mission is only secondarily for the glory of Palgolak, and primarily for the glory of knowledge, which is why they are sworn to admit all who wish to enter into their library.

The New Crobuzon Palgolak Library has the best collection of religious manuscripts known in the world of Bas-Lag, and it therefore attracts pilgrims from a huge variety of religious traditions and factions. They throng the northern ends of Brock Marsh and Spit Hearth, all the worshipping races of the Bas-Lag, in robes and masks, sporting whips, leashes, magnifying glasses, the whole gamut of religious paraphernalia.

---

*Godmech Cogs and One True God*

The followers of One True God are the Godmech Cogs, believers in a mechanised, construct-like cosmos. Worshippers may be found across the city, with interlocking wheels tattooed across their arms, attempting to convert those unfortunate enough to have decided to engage a Cog in casual conversation. Despite their reputation for heated theological debate however, the Godmech Cogs are egalitarian and, even at their worst, mostly harmless.

---

*Codling Brood*

The viciously anti-xenian Codling Brood is growing in the city. Their theologies lead them to a violent human supremacy which have some associating with the Three Quills party; it would not be unsuprising to find a member of the Brood patrolling some moonlit poorer district with a Quiller gang, out to "keep their city clean".

---

*Church of the Clock Gods*

The religion of the clock gods is one more closely associated with the citizens of Shankell (the city that lies on the southern coastline of the Meagre Sea). Churches can be found in New Crobuzon though, with the ululating hymn to Sanshad, the sun god, able to be heard belted through their windows. A newer religion in the city, the teachings of the clock gods only found their way over the Meagre Sea some thirty years ago, but, since then, many of the sublties and nuances of the theology has been lost. Worshippers in New Crobuzon, however, have a certain rowdy zeal that their cousins in Shankell lack.

---

*Manifold Horizon*

Very few if any temples to the Manifold Horizon exist in New Crobuzon, and only a handful of believers may be found, at most.

Worship in the tradition of the Manifold Horizon is split into its various 'Moments'. The Moments of the Manifold Horizon are as diverse as they are numerous: Cadmer, Moment of Calculation; Zaori, Moment of Magic Wine; Pharru, Moment of Forgotten Snow; Tekke Shesim, Moment of Memory; Tekke Vogu; Moment of the Hidden and Lost; Moment of Doves; Moment of Desiccation. Monks fully dedicated to such Moments may learn thaumaturgic abilities associated with each. A monk of Tekke Vogu, for example, is utterly enfolded in the Moment, giving them the power to uncover a hidden truth in exchange for something forcably and painfully hidden from them about their self, their past, or even parts of their physical bodies; their dedicatation also leaves them totally unseen. Monks of Zaori, on the other hand, may experience visions upon drinking certain liquids. Those monks dedicated to the Moment of Desiccation possess the power to turn blood to ash, among other abilities.

The Manifold Horizon is primarily a Teshi religion, so any worshippers to have successfully arived in New Crobuzon will have come very far indeed, since Tesh lies on the far south-west side of the contient from New Crobuzon.

---

*Non-Belief*

Given the vast quantity and variety of traditions and pantheons in the city, one would be forgiven for believing that New Crobuzon's inhabitants were, on the whole, deeply religious. In truth, this is often far from the case. It is true that most believe, justifiably, in the existence of other aspects of reality – they can, after all, be communicated with, and even visited. Alternate planes may indeed be inhabited by beings and essences with immense power, in human terms at least, but, says the non-believer, taking the leap to call these beings “gods” is unncessary, and worshipping them would be close to pointless.

---

#### Technology and Economy

---

For readers, it might be most useful to imagine the technology of New Crobuzon as broadly 'Victorian': trains, ships, cranes and all manner of industrial eqiupment are powered by steam engines burning coal or, more rarely, oil; the city is lit by gas, both in the streets and in homes; large cameras have the ability to capture still images, that, when developed, render a scene in sepia (what is known as a heliotype); and horse-drawn carriages transport passengers around the city (although the horses may be Remade, or indeed not horses at all but some weirder cousin - a pterabird or a beast from the northern tundra -  or even a Remade individual, both cabdriver and cab). New Crobuzon does, however, lack any system of near-instant communication, either by written text or spoken word; messages are delivered by letter using a system of cheap stamps and postal workers, and post arrives regularly.

In its system of production and exchange, New Crobuzon is firmly capitalist: its industry is based on socialised, production-line manufacturing done in large factories, whilst exchange of goods and services mostly takes place in small local shops or in markets. Raw matierals and commodities are transported around the city via train and canal, leaving and entering via New Crobuzon's vast dockyards. There are still some tradespeople whose craft has not yet found itself part of the city's industrial machine however, and who both produce and sell out of their own premises; many professional thaumaturges make their living this way. All this leaves New Crobuzon with a fairly well defined system of classes, with an indsturial working class, who work long hours in poor conditions in factories owned by a wealthy class of industrialists and, between them, a middle class of small business owners and artisans who, in many cases, are being pressed into more and more worker-like conditions.

The currency of the city is diverse, but the most common denominations are, in order of worth: stivers, shekels, and nobels. Also used are pennies, marks and guineas, with gold pieces also respected. **A note for GMs here: whilst the books are not completely clear on the exact worth of each denomination, their approximate worth, which can be used with the prices indicated by the *Genesys Core Rulebook* and other resources, can be treated as follows. (It might be assumed that the multitude of names arises from a system similar to British £sd, outlined [here](http://projectbritain.com/moneyold.htm#:~:text=Before%20decimalization%20on%2015%20February,four%20farthings%20(quarter%20pennies).&text=The%20pre%2Ddecimalisation%20British%20system,introduced%20by%20King%20Henry%20II.).)**

**One stiver = 5.**

**One shekel = 50.**

**One noble = 100.**

Science in New Crobuzon progresses alongside industry. Breakthroughs of physics, biology and chymistry from the New Crobuzon University, which today progress at steady rate, inform development in the production process and drive it forward. This dynamic is apparent to all Crobuzoners who live on the banks of the city's rivers, where the stink of chymical overflows permiates many of the less rich districts - the smell of a university lab multiplied a thousandfold. Khrepi must bathe monthly in prophylactics to avoid the itches and sores.

Below are some stranger or particular aspects of New Crobuzon's technology and industry that may benefit from further description.

---

*Constructs*

Constructs in New Crobuzon can be found everywhere and anywhere. Wherever there is a job to be done, you will more than likely find a construct doing its best to complete it. There is huge variety among constructs, but a universal definition might describe a non-sentient, artificial, programmable machine, designed, in most cases, to complete a specific task automatically. Constructs can be chrome or steel, iron or brass or copper, wood or glass; they might be huge military models, designed for conquest and death, intelligent enough to act on spoken orders, or else simple automatic road-drills, given instructions via a basic interface of physical buttons. Whilst most operate by a complex system of miniture pistons and levers, powered by high-pressure steam generated by a coal furnace, there are also elytric, thaumaturgic and chymical designs.

All constructs, however, interpret instructions, and indeed the world more broadly, via an internal analytical engine. This is the construct's 'brain': its design greatly affects how the construct will act and its complexity allows the construct greater or lesser 'intelligence'. Programme cards connected to this engine will determine the exact responses of the construct to instructions, and these can be swapped in and out should an owner wish to, for example, switch a household assistant construct from a cleaning, to a cooking mode. 

Readers should note that, whilst it is also a powerful piece of technology, a *difference* engine is no analytical engine. The former is essentially a machine to perform complex calculations; the latter is a computing machine - it can respond to the world - it can 'think'.

---

*Dirigibles and the Skyrail*

While most of New Crobuzon's citizens travel by foot, cab, or train, the city also allows for transport by air, via both dirigible and skyrail.

The booming whalesong of the city's dirigible airships can be heard throughout the day and night. Property of the state and the very-rich, the dirigibles of New Crobuzon serve as leisure vehicles, troop carriers and viewing platforms, as well as, occaisonally, means of mid- to long-distance travel. Aerostats and dirgibles moor at militia towers or the private mooring posts of the richer districts' manors.

New Crobuzon's skyrail is one of the city's unique features. Seven huge, thrumming wires eminate from Perdido Street Station and knot the city together, criss-crossing between the districts' militia towers. Beneath the elyctric rail, small dangling pods streak toward their destinations, providing fast transport for militia and other state officials. 

---

*Elyctricity*

A rarer means of power than steam, generation of elyctrical currents is nevertheless a possiblity in the city, and various industries find a use for it. Elyctricity can equally be used at a smaller-scale - to power a construct, or as part of a weapon. It can also be combined with thaumaturgic or chymical technology, for example in the case of an elyctro-thaumaturgic barb gun, or a chymical, thaumaturgic or metaclockwork battery.

---

*Metaclockwork*

A khepri invention, metaclockwork technology is extraordinary for its level of intricacy. Finding various applications in personal equipment and industry, its most well-known use is the khepri stingbox - a distinctive weapon that uses a metaclockwork engine to allow two thick, spike tipped cords to be whirled and thrown at a target, piecing armour and skin, and griping horrifically inside the torn flesh of the victim. The metaclockwork of the stingbox allows the cords to extend when thrown, without friction, for more than twenty feet, and weird currents to be sent into the target, leaving them spasming in pain.

---

*Thaumaturgy*

Thaumaturgy has a huge influence on the technologies of New Crobuzon. Batteries, converters and all manner of thaumaturgic technologies allow for the powering of strange engines and the operation of weird industries, and its combination with other means of power opens up even further avenues for technological usage, both at a personal and industrial scale.

---

*The Torque*

Of the many energies and powerful forces in Bas-Lag, the vast majority can be, broadly speaking, understood, theorised about, and even manipulated. The Torque is no such energy. Where the power of a rushing river, with help from engineers, scientists and labourers, can be used to power a cotton mill, or diverted to destroy a village, Torquic power, with all the engineers, scientists and labourers in New Crobuzon, cannot be controlled, for good or ill. It is a rouge, pathological force. All attempts to tap it have met horrific ends.

Over two-hundred years ago, nearing the end of the Pirate Wars, New Crobuzon dropped Torque bombs on Suroch. It would be easier to imagine that nothing, today, remained of that once-great city; the reality is far worse. Houses became molten, shifting statues; insects contorted into thick tree-like structures and calcified; the sentient inhabitants of the city bent into strange shapes and now wander the constantly distorting wasteland in herds. A hundred years later, the city sent a secret research mission to Suroch, to see the long-term effects of the war. So horrified was the heliotypist, Sacramundi, at what he saw, that he leaked copies of his heliotypes to bookshops across the city. The riots that ensued nearly brought down the government. This has largely been forgotten today, but no Torquic experiments have since been conducted.

Far to the south-west of the city, there is a centuries-old Torque rift - the Cacotopic Stain, where Torquic energies are constantly raging. Some, drinking in pubs in Kelltree or Dog Fenn, will claim to have seen it and returned alive, pointing to an extra toe or disfigured eye as proof. They are seldom believed, but the details of their stories are, on occaison, uncannily life-like.

#### Thaumaturgy

---

Thaumaturgy is part the physical science of the university laboratory, and part the magic of fairytale and myth.

Like science, thaumaturgy can be rigourously studied, and theories, models and mathematical renderings fill the textbooks on the subject in the New Crobuzon University library. It can also be used to great effect in industry, with powerful thaumaturgic currents able to power strange engines that coal or oil could not. Thaumaturgy may even be studied directly alongside science: the anatomies of many creatures in Bas-Lag have thaumaturgic elements, such as the vodyanoi's ablity to perform watercraeft, or the stiltspear's innate ability to secrete thaumaturgeons to camoflage themselves; some more unorthodox scientists and thaumaturge-academics even theorise that thaumaturgons (the theoretical particles whose maniuplation makes thaumaturgy possible) are essentially the same kind of thing as protons, elyctrons, and the physical subatomic particles.

Unlike science however, thaumaturgy is a physical and mental skill, practisable by individuals. However hard and long the physicist pores over her books, she will never be able to alter the variables of gravitational pull which she studies, or influence elyctrons to create lightning, no matter how well she knows the physical processes of a storm. Unlike the physicist, but like the practioner of 'magic', a thaumaturge can do these things. With some combination of spoken words, bodily motion, written symbols and, crucially, the particular combination of concentration and emotional release known as cathexis, a thaumaturge can influence the physical and non-phyiscal elements of the world to their will. In general, anyone can learn a few basic hexes and matter-shaping techniques given application, but the most powerful thaumaturges are those who have studied and practised for decades.

Thaumaturges in New Crobuzon are often artisans, selling their specific trade from a shopfront in Brockmarsh or The Crow, a bagder familiar completing errands on their behalf. You will also find many, however, in academia, government research, and in the militia, whose captain-thaumaturges are adept at unleashing thaumaturgic bolts of glowing unlight at enemies of the state who attempt to resist.

Below are some of the particular techniques and disciplines of thaumaturgy, but not all thaumaturgy falls into a category, and some hexes might straddle multiple techniques. For how thaumaturgy relates to *Genesys* gameplay, see the section on the [Thaumaturge](#Thaumaturge) career, or the thaumaturgy section under the [Skills](#thaumaturgic-skills) section.

---

*Biothaumaturgy*

The most well-known examples of biothaumaturgy in New Crobuzon are the Remade - those who have been tried and punished by the state in the city's infamous punishment factories - and so, in this sense, biothaumaturgy is part of what makes New Crobuzon the city it is. A biothaumaturge tears at and recreates flesh, bonds it in unintended ways, and manipulates it within the limits dictated only by imagination of the thaumaturge themself. It can be used to heal, but biothaumaturgy's horrifying use as a weapon of the state has somewhat overshadowed its more positive uses.

---

*Chromathaumaturgy*

If a thaumaturge wishes to alter the appearence of an object or person, or simply create a colourful light show, she may turn to the study and use of chromathaumaturgy - the thaumaturgic discipline which can influence colour and light.

---

*Communicator Thaumaturgy*

The thaumaturgy employed by a communicator (or communicatrix if the thaumaturge is female) allows the user to embody another person - a person perhaps hundreds of miles away - such that communication with the seperated person is possible. By 'harmonising' with the conciousness of another, those in the presence of the communicator may converse with that individual as they would with the thaumaturge ordinarily. For such powerful thaumaturgy, the communicator requires a small engine connected to a distinctive helmet - usually with a rotatable trumpet jutting from its front - and, preferably, a number of objects owned by or related to the embodied person. Though the communicator's features may shift weirdly to mimic those of the individual being harmonised with, that individual does not experience a change in their physical surroundings, rather, those people in the communicator's presence appear to them as ghostly apparitions. 

Though this is the most impressive of the communicator's thaumaturgic abilities, they may also be useful to any organisation that requires surveillance; a proficient communicator may be able to gain impressions of the thoughts of individuals at a distance. With some deciphering, those thoughts may be identified as subversive.

---

*Elementalist Thaumaturgy*

Beast-tamers of a preternatural  kind, elementalists (or 'elementarii') are thaumaturges capable of bringing into being sentient elements - elementals - to aid them in whatever task the elemental in question is appropriate for. Undines, for example, are water elementals popular with vodyanoi thaumaturges for maintaining the natural, healthy moisture-level of their skin; luftgeists are air elementals of huge power often utilised for their offensive capablities; yags are animalistic, fire elementals, sometimes dangerous, sometimes small and tame enough to keep as (something like) a pet. There are also stranger elementals: elementals of elyctricity, metal, sun, wood, darkness, even flesh.

---

*Elyctro-thaumaturgy*

Less the skill of a single thaumaturge, elyctro-thaumaturgy is more often used when building thaumaturgic weaponry or equipment. A handheld elyctro-thaumaturgic weapon might, for example, throw arcs of weird current twisting through the air before striking its target.

---

*Empathic Thaumaturgy*

Empaths are thaumaturges whose skill is associated with the emotional spectrum. Whilst the most useful ability of an empath may be the ability to sense and socially adapt to the emotions of an individual, they can also feel close-by sapient presences, which might come in handy in an situation in which the thaumaturge is expecting any kind of surprise attack. 

---

*Geoempathic Thaumaturgy*

By some combination of geothaumaturgic and empathic techniques, the geoempath is able to sense subterranean formations and the presence of particular substances. In the mining of raw materials this is particuarly useful, with geoempaths being employed to direct the construction of mine shafts or similar.

---

*Geothaumaturgy*

More directly and obviously powerful than its geoempathic cousin, the geothaumaturgic hex will physically affect the earth in various ways. The most common employment given to geothaumaturges is that of tunneller, or demolitionsman, with the thaumaturge turning stone into slurry with their bare hands and a few whispered words. 

---

*Karcist Thaumaturgy*

A karcist is a thaumaturge able to communicate with and pull certain dæmons through the aether into our world. Some dæmons are perfectly sapient, and Hell even maintains an embassy in New Crobuzon (with a resident karcist to allow communication between planes), whilst others are more animalistic or, at least, more acquiescent, and are able to be conjured by a karcist for their offensive capablities. Interacting with the Pit in any respect, however, requires taking a number of precautions and accounting for many different varibles to prevent disaster. The karcist will also require various dæmonological equipment to perform any thaumaturgic operations, unless of course she is knowledgable enough to learn the arcane languages and enact the particular sacrificial rituals that were necessary before the invention of such equipment; few are still in the possession of this knowledge. 

---

*Metallo-thaumaturgy*

Similar to bio- and geo- thaumaturgy, metallo-thaumaturgy involves the shaping of a certain kind of material, in this case, metal. Where a welder might suffice, or even be preferable, for certain metal-working jobs, the metallo-thaumaturge can influence the thaumaturgic energies in such a way to meld metal with their bare hands and, as such, can perform on the fly much more easily. The thaumaturge can also give metals weird puissance and thaumaturgic properties, useuful in some industries.

---

*Meteoromancy* 

The meteoromance is the thaumaturge concerned primarily with weather and atmosphere. This thaumaturge's hex might, depending on their skill and power, cause a small rain shower, displace fog infront of a moving ship or simply cause a small gust to dry a line of laundry. The New Crobuzon government has its own meteoromancers for predicting the city's long-term weather, generally season by season. In the Tar Wedge cloudtower, there lies a dormant aeromorphic engine that rises, organ like, vertically the height of the hollow tower, but no meteoromance in a hundred and fifty years has had the knowledge or cathexic potency to restart its operations.

---

*Somaturgy/Golemetry*

The thaumaturgic art of the golemist or somaturge is the art of intervention and persuasion, but not of the sapient mind, but of inanimate matter. The golemist intervenes in the static, persistently lifeless nature of the rock and nudges it in the direction of order and self-organisation; a golem is created. Like a construct, a golem may be 'programmed' with certain behaviours by the somaturge upon creation, and will act out these until it dispates, but, like a construct, a golem may also take instruction from its creator whilst in possession of its not-life.

The larger, more complex and longer-lasting the golem, the more exhausted the golemist becomes. The primary cathexic exursion occurs upon creation and instruction; a relatively simple golem, therefore, may stand guard for sometime without completely exhausting its creator. This is all relative, of course, on the thaumaturge's skill and training.

Golems can be made out of almost anything, so long as that something is inanimate. For golems with specific purposes, or in need of animation quickly or by a weaker somaturge, a ready-made may be used - an already-constructed form which is then animated. In theory, noncorporeal golems are a possiblity, but even the few somaturge academics at the city's university have not successfully created anything more formless than a gas golem.

There is little money in golemtry in the city at present, since even the most complex golems are bested by a good construct.

---

*Subvocalurgy*

The practiser of subvocalurgy is what is known as a whispersmith, or susurrator. A whispersmith cannot speak in the way the average person can, but instead must whisper across the air, directly into the ear of a nearby person. Not only this, but, when given certain inflections, the whipsersmith's susurrus may direct, hypnosis-like, the listener to act in accordance with the smith's will. The better the whispersmith, the further they can be heard, and the more complex minds they can affect. Such a practise is rare in New Crobuzon, and where is is practised, it is generally done by untrustworthy individuals.

### The World: Bas-Lag

![Map of Rohagi Continent](https://i.imgur.com/ymH5Zi4.jpg)

The world of Bas-Lag is immense, and no one individual has, or perhaps can have, a complete understanding of its vast geographies. The city of New Crobuzon sits close to the east coast of the continent of Rohagi, but is by no means its capital, nor does it reflect the culture of the continent's peoples, which are unimaginably diverse. The Ragamoll-speaking humans of New Crobuzon can hardly be compared to the grindylow of the Cold Claw Sea - indeed, whether the latter's model of conciousness can even be considered related to the former's is still an open question. Trade does nevertheless take place between the nations and cities of Rohagi. Ships have even been sent to, and received from, the east across the Meagre Sea - the continent of Bered Kai Nev and the Crobuzoner colony of Nova Esperium.

Whilst this guide is intended for adventures in and around the city of New Crobuzon, players and GMs will certainly benefit from knowledge of the broader world. New Crobuzon is a hub of so many culutres, and a stop for so many merchant ships and travellers, a vistor from as far away as Khadoh, or the Witchocracy, or even High Cromlech, whilst rare, may nevertheless be found. More intrepid GMs may even wish to take their players further afield than the city - to gain some hidden knowledge from the last anophelii settlement - south of Gnurr Kett, or hunt the great floating city of Armada. Such players should take care.

---

*Amarda*

The huge floating city-state of Armada has sailed the Swollen Ocean for between one- and three-thousand years. A city of pirates and press-ganged citizens of a hundred different cultures and races, Amarda's population today numbers some hundred-thousand, all residing on the vast number of ships stolen and lashed together that make up the city. Though it only spans a mile wide, Amarda's streets are as countless as those in New Crobuzon, owing its layers upon layers of decks. Armada thrives on piracy and, through this method, has added great wealth to itself over the centuries. Despite this however, the city has remained a close-to-total secret, since any ship intercepted by Armadan forces is assimilated into the city, and its crew and passengers are press-ganged into citizenship for life. Lucky for those criminals and Remade shipped to Nova Esperium as slave-labour - treated with dignity on the floating city; less lucky for the rich colonalist businessman.

---

*The Anophelii Island, Gnurr Kett and Kohnid*

On a tiny island some two-hundred miles south of the island nation of Gnurr Kett, there remains the last surviving society of anophelii. Some two-thousand years ago, the mosquito-people maintained a vast empire that spanned huge swaths of Rohagi, Shoteka and many of their surrounding islands, and though the Malarial Queendom is all but forgotten amongst the anophelii themselves, the authorities of the once-subjugated nations remember all too well. Over the many hundreds of years since, a long-standing agreement has formed between the sailors of Dreer Samher and the Gnurr Kett authorities in Kohnid. The Samheri cactacae, their sap-based circulatory systems shielding them from the she-anophelii's blood-hunger, come to the island with livestock and a few trade goods, and take their cut as middlemen. Kohnid buys from them whatever the anophelii give, but, what they seeks primarily, is the intelligence of the he-anopheli philosophers. Kohnid is playing a game, keeping the brilliant anophelii as pet thinkers; giving them nothing that might make them powerful, or let them escape - Kohnid cannot not risk unleashing a single she-anophelus on the world again - but just enough to think with. The Kettai must not allow anophelii access to any information outside of its control, but the centuries-long maintenance of High Kettai as the island’s only written language ensures that. This way, anophelii science and philosophy are in the hands of the Kohnid elite, who are almost alone in being able to read the old language. Kohnid's university libraries are filled with the fruits of anophelii intellectual labour, all creditted to Kettai scholars.

---

*Bered Kai Nev*

It has been some six-and-a-half centuries since the New Crobuzon explorer Seemly crossed the Swollen Ocean and discovered the eastern continent of Bered Kai Nev. Since then though, the government has had little contact with any nation on the continent, and maintains no permanent consuls. The most notable 'contact' was when, five-hundred and fifty years later, khepri refugee ships crawled, barely afloat, into Iron Bay. Their enormous clockwork motors were rusted and broken, their sails ragged. They were charnel ships, packed with thousands of Bered Kai Nev khepri who were only just alive. Though there were khepri already in the city in small numbers, this influx saw the birth of the khepri ghettos that we see today.

---

*Cacotopic Stain*

The Cacotopic Stain is perhaps unlike anywhere else on the continent of Rohagi. Weird, horrific energies known as the Torque create a shifting, distorting landscape; any life that finds its home there is similarly distorted and warped; and no living being can enter and leave precisely the same. The Torque-wounded suffer monstrous effects - tenticles sprouting from the eyes, or holes appearing in the body, one after another, without blood or pain, until nothing remains. The Torquic rift appeared some five-hundred years ago, and it shows no sign of disipating. Travellers should avoid at all costs.

---

*Cobsea*

Set in the vast plains to the south-east, Cobsea is New Crobuzon's smaller neighbour. On relatively good terms, industrialists in the two settlements had planned for a railway to stretch the hundreds of miles and connect them. Before these plans could get close to beginning however, the money had run out. There had been some financial crisis, some speculative bubble had burst, some trade network had collapsed under the weight of competition and a plethora of too-cheap products no one could buy, and the project had been killed before it could even be born.

---

*The Cymek, Dreer Samher and Shankell*

The Cymek, Rohagi's vast southern peninsula, is a harsh place, known for its dry, punishing heat. There is, nevertheless, civilisation to be found. Nomadic tribes of egilitarian garuda move about the skies, seeking food and water; the cactacae of the great northern city of Shankell fill the seats of its gladiatorial fleshpits and hookwire cages; and, in the south, the fablers of the proud pirate-merchant city Dreer Samher make the gathered crowds drunk on their hypnogogic voices, telling and retelling the stories of old wars and lost loves. But the Cymek is most famous amongst scholars and theologists for its huge libary, which is carried on the backs of a garuda clan. The Cymek Library is considered one of the largest and most comprehensive in Rohagi.

---

*High Cromlech*

To the citizens of New Crobuzon, the city of High Cromlech is virtually mythical; as more senior state officials well know, however, the city of the abdead is as real as New Crobuzon itself. A near-impossible journey away, the few successful travellers will find a city in an all-encompassing quiet. The mindless zombies that make up the majority of the workforce in the city are near-silent, and the blood-addict vampir are creatures of few words. The thanati proper, the aristocracy, are abdead liches with beautiful clothes and skin like preserved leather; their mouths are sewn shut. The noise in the city comes from a small number of living humans - the quick. A minority of low status, the quick are mostly farm-bred and kept in cages until they are strong enough to be processed into zombies, or raised by the aristocracy until they come of age, then to be slain and welcomed into dead society. Then there is Liveside, the quick ghetto, where the living carry out the more intricate labour that zombies cannot perform and the taboo professions that the thaniti distain. On a rare occaison, a higher-class quick - a liveman or livewife - will earn enough to have themselves put down and join the ranks of the abdead aristocracy. Liveman becomes deadman.

---

*Maru'ahm*

The city of Maru'ahm is known, if it is known at all by Crobuzoners, for one thing - gambling. Gambling in Maru'ahm is not simply a popular means of entertainment; it is the basis of society. Legislation is not made, in the senate chamber or court room, but won at the card table; life and death, servitude and freedom, are all decided in games of grandbridge, black sevens, and quincehand.

---

*Myrshock*

With the exclusion of Cobsea, Myrshock is New Crobuzon's closest city neighbour. An ugly port, the architecture of Myrshock appears thrown together. Where it is designed, its aesthetic is unsure - churches with cement facades mimicking antique curlicues, banks using slate in uncommon colours, achieving only vulgarity. Like New Crobuzon, Myrshock is mixed. Humans live beside cactacae, and garuda dapple the air as well as the streets; there are vodyanoi in canal ghettos.

Sitting on the north costal edge of the Meagre Sea, visitors from the Cymek will often cross through the port town of Myrshock on their way to New Crobuzon. If the railway, that had once been planned to cross the swamps and link the two cities along with Cobsea, had been sucessful, there might well have been far more visitors from the south in New Crobuzon today, but, as it was, the project was cancelled before it had even began. You may nevertheless see a floating factory from Myrshock stopping in Kelltree docks, or, if your security clearance allows, walk past the Myrshock embassy that resides, alongside most other embassise in the city, on one of the upper floors of Perdido Street Station's Mandragorae Wing.

---

*Nova Esperium*

Half way across the world, the offical depiction of Nova Esperium is that of a small, bright, glittering city - impressive towers and grain silos, vast beautiful forests surrounding it, filled with unique animals. In truth, on an unmapped continent to the east, New Crobuzon's colony is a little blister of civilization; the lives of its residents are hard and often short. Eager for new citizens, Nova Esperium will ask no questions and even pay skilled labourers to take the dangerous journey across the Meagre Sea. The majority of the colony's workforce, however, have little choice in the matter; they are prisoners, indentured laborers, and Remade. The land's indigenous peoples fair even worse. Colonists rarely return, but ships from Nova Esperium do dock in Iron Bay at least annually.

---

*Rudewood*

A vast forest just to the south of New Crobuzon, for many, Rudewood is part of city; the wood even has its own derelict train station, now surrended to green life. Adventurous Crobuzoners or bored youths can follow the overgrown tracks for a day of foraging or hunting or fire-lighting. Not that Rudewood is particularly safe for the city-dweller; the forest teams with life - strange predators slip between the great trees after dark, huge bears-like things made up of birds and flies move through the undergrowth.

---

*Salkrikaltor*

While its borders are somewhat nebulous, The Cray Commonwealth of Salkrikaltor (or simply - Salkrikaltor) most commonly refers to those waters enclosed by the islands of Gnomon Tor, Bartoll and the Fins, some hundreds of miles east of Iron Bay. Its capital, Salkrikaltor City, is a submerged city. Some towers and rooftops break the surface of the waves; they are rendered in concrete, in iron, rock and glass, and in sweeps of hardy cold-water coral. Columns spiraled with walkways, linked by spine-thin bridges. Intricate conical spires a hundred feet high. Newer-looking, ovoid mansions carved from stone and ribbed with iron, suspended above the water on struts that jut from the submerged roofscape. Floating platforms topped with terraces of square brick houses - like those of New Crobuzon - perch preposterously in the sea. The true city, however, lies beneath the waves. A bustling metropolis, Salkrikaltor City is just as much a city as New Crobuzon, from its outer suburbs of low buildings in porous stone and coral, to the monumental architecture at its centre - cathedrals and factories, government buildings and central banks. Many of the buildings, in in traditional Salkrikaltor style, have large windows and doorways, so that small fish can enter and exit unhindered.

With the exception of the small human minority that live above-water, the majority of Salkrikaltor's populous are the cray. Above the torso, they appear similar to humans but for a small ruff of gills on the neck, below it however, they are armoured, and in possession of scuttling, segmented legs as well as a tail. Just as the human resembles the ape, the he-cray resembles the lobster. The cray of the commonwealth keep good relations with New Crobuzon, and trade occurs regularly.

---

*Shoteka and the Witchocracy*

What little is known about the southern continent of Shoteka arrives at New Crobuzon through stories of the Witchocracy - Shud Zar Myrion Zar Koni - a witch-ruled society with ever-strange, ever-uncertain relations with the city. Whilst much is said of the Witchocracy, exclaimed by drunks in Dog Fenn bars or whispered between children before bed, very little of it is ever true.

---

*Suroch*

Since the end of the Pirate Wars (or the 'Slow War' or the 'False War'), the once-proud city of Surroch has been in ruins. In 1545, New Crobuzon dropped a colourbomb on Suroch. It was said that this, at long last, was what ended the wars. In truth, there had been no war for over a year, not since New Crobuzon has unleashed the Torque. The final explosive did indeed level much of the city's centre, but it was not an attack, rather, the colourbomb had been an attempt to hide the nightmare created by the bombardment a year's prior. The effect of New Crobuzon's Torque bombs is apparent to anyone who dare enter the city, though no one has done for a hundred years. The landscape shifts; trees, once cockroaches, buckle and snap from the force of Torquic winds only to reform; molten houses contort, their residents wandering the city in ravenous herds.

---

*Tesh*

Tesh, City of the Crawling Liquid, is, in some ways, New Crobuzon's twin. A large, prosperous city, sitting near the coast; its industries are developed, as are its armed forces. But Tesh is not like New Crobuzon - it is an alien place. Teshi science is unrecognisable, its technologies and thaumaturgy are arcane and many of its cultural practices are indecipherable to Crobuzoners, except by one or two academics and diplomats, who themselves distort and misunderstand. Many Crobuzoners know a little of Tesh - its moats and glass cats, and the Catoblepas Plain, merchant trawlers and tramp diplomats and the Crying Prince - but very few have anything resembling a correct, let alone complete, picture of the city.

---

*The Gengris*

Lodged like an impurity in the southern jag of the Cold Claw Sea is an extraordinary, dangerous place, something between an island, a half-sunk city, and a myth. An amphibious badland about which the civilized world knows next to nothing, except that it exists and that it is dangerous. That place is The Gengris. It is said to be the home of the grindylow, aquatic demons or monsters or degenerate crossbred men and women, depending on which story one believes. The grindylow, or The Gengris (the distinction between race and place is unclear), control the south of the Cold Claw Sea with unbreakable power and a cruel, capricious isolationism. Their waters are lethal and uncharted. Only the most senior officials of New Crobuzon are aware of the precise nature of The Gengris, although they do engage in limited trade. Like Tesh and the Witchocracy, Gengris culture appears totally alien; unlike the former, however, the rules of the grindylow cannot be learnt. Transgressions are often deadly.

---

### Elsewhere

The land of Bas-Lag, its oceans and deserts, forests and cityscapes, is, it seems, not the only world in or on which life can exist. They are *other* places. Whether these places are actually geographical - whether a traveller could fly upward, past the moon and her orbiting daughters and into the blackness beyond, and find somewhere *else* - or whether only the abyssonauts, explorers with trans-dimensional aspirations, could complete the journey between here and there, it is unclear. What is certain, however, is that the universe is far larger than many would have you believe.

---

*The Eastern Rim of the Universe*

The origins of the Ghosthead Empire are confused and inconsistent. The imperial texts that survive are translations of translations, and the weird artefacts of that all-powerful empire that are scattered across Bas-Lag, resist study. The empire is remembered though (and still feared) in varying degrees by all the sapient races, but it is mostly its defeat - the Contumancy and the Sloughing Off after it - that is recalled, if only as myth. Its origins are forgotten, almost totally. The most well-researched scholarly texts, however, found in the Cymek Library or at New Crobuzon University, might say something resembling the following.

Thousands of years ago, on the eastern rim of the universe, there was a world where each morning came with a wall of fire, so hot that it would ignite the air, burn the mountains, and blind anyone who raised their gaze, even from the bottom of the deepest ocean. As the day went, the fire moved across the sky from east to west, and the wall became a disc, a sun, slowly receeding. By noon, the world became cold and, by dusk, the cold was unimaginable. The world became enveloped in layers of ice and frost; the very gases, the very aether piled up in bergs and walls, chilled more solid than stone. By night, the sun was a distant star, but when day broke, the fire returned again. This was the Ghosthead homeworld. When the Ghosthead arrived on Bas-Lag, so temperate by comparison, having travelled through the dark sea of stars in the belly of a great metal fish, this is what they escaped.

---

*The Fractured Land and The Scar*

More than three-thousand years ago, the Ghosthead came to Bas-Lag. They arrived with such force and violence, that the world split open; reality itself was torn. An impossible journey from Iron Bay, the Scar still exists. More than two-thousand miles across, and with hundreds of miles between its two sides, there is a fissure in the ocean, jagged and weird. In between, is the emptiness - the Scar itself. Energies pour from it; possible realities swirl together and break apart; potentiality and possiblity well up about the lesion; the ocean waters are thick with seams of what might be. In the days of the empire, the Ghosthead's dominance relied on their ability to *mine* that possiblity, tapping the wound that they had created. With this industry, they created circuits and engines and weaponry, shaping reality to their preferred possiblity. With this industry, they ruled Bas-Lag for some five-hundred years.

The Fractured Land Hypothesis, posited by any scientist in New Crobuzon, will be met, by most academics, with a derisive snort or patronising smile. The notion of a mythical, nightmarish land, untold thousands of miles away, filled with monsters, where the rules of reality break down, and all caused by some unknown, untheorised force - this, to many academics, is psuedo-science. But when the Ghosthead arrived and broke the world, this is precisely what was thrown up - the Fractured Land, the Broken Country, with its inhabitants of terrible things, a dreadful ecology. Lightfungus. Dreadcurs. Butterflies with unholy appetites. If it does exist, who would dare search for it?

---

*Hell*

Once shrouded in mystery, only contactable in strange languages and via the sacrifice of live animals, the plane of Hell now maintains an embassy in New Crobuzon, and the relations with the Hellkin are friendly. The karcists of New Crobuzon have, today, automated the process of extraplanar innvocation using engines and circuits to create victimless sacrifices and dispense with the need for dæmon linguistics. Not that the process is easy of course - the pressure fronts of the æther, moving powerstorms through the abyss and null-space and into the borderlands, can cause distruptions - but, with the variables accounted for, communication is possible. Communicated with in this fashion, the dæmons of Hell take the shape of ordinary humans, though their normal voices precede a terrible, tormented echo of the same. Some karcists take the view that this echo is, due to some distortion, spoken first, and the *real* echo is therefore the smooth, calm voice that the dæmon presents to its listeners. Whether this implies that the Hellkin are, as they might have you believe, the damned souls of the living, it is unclear.

---

*The Worldweb*

One of the more alien creatures of Bas-Lag, the Weaver is, ostensibly, a great spider. Its bulbous, hanging abdomen is some seven feet long and five wide; its jet black head is the size of a grown human's chest; its constellation of huge, deep red eyes do not blink. Unlike a spider, it has six legs, although it often walks on its hindmost four. Of the front two sets, one set is tipped with sharp talons of dark chitin. From the other, extent two slender, child-like hands, without nails and pitch black. A Weaver is intelligent, or so it seems. It's model of conciousness, however, is completely alien. It cannot be bought or reasoned with. It speaks in an unending rhythm of dream-poetics. A Weaver's only want is to perfect the beauty of the worldweb, which seems, to any typical sapient mind, utterly abitary. The snapping of scissors, the severing of human ears, the moving of chess pieces, the kidnapping of apparently random citizens - these things may appeal to the Weaver's sense of beauty, or they may not. The worldweb is also the Weaver's means of movement. Slipping between this and that, here and there, the Weaver steps lightly over the worldweb, scuttling across metareal filaments connecting every moment to every other. To any normal mind, to witness the worldweb could only cause an overwhelming existential terror.

## Races

The races and species of Bas-Lag are uncountable in number. Such diversity exists in the world that it would surely be impossible for any xenologist, even of the greatest university, to document even close to a complete picture of the manifold forms of life. The city of New Crobuzon itself is a mixing pot of possibly hundreds of sentient races, of so many different cultures. Presented below, however, is a summary of the races more commonly found in the city, along with the details required to play each of them as part of a *Genesys* campaign.

---

### Cactacae

Most commonly found in the settlments of the Cymek, the cactus people - cactacae - are, nevertheless, a relatively common sight in New Crobuzon, making up approximately 2% of the population. Standing between 7 and 8 foot tall, the cactacae are a vegatable race with thick, fiberous green skin (although yellow and browns are sometimes seen). Spines and small flowers protrude from the cactus individual if left unplucked, although many choose to do so. Cactacae heads sit flat on their shoulders, without necks. Their fingers are thick and fairly clumsy, although their grip is power enough to crush bone. An oily sap flows through their veins rather than blood, and their bones are strangely shaped, unlike those of any vertebate. A full-grown cactacae is not just tall but also massive, weighing as much as 500 to 700 pounds. Prefering hotter climates, many of the city's cactacae reside in the semi-autonomous cactus ghetto - the Glasshouse - although many can be found in the neighbouring district of Riverskin.

*Starting Skills*: A cactacae gains one rank in Resililence or Coercion.

*Large*: A cactacae is silhouette 2.

*Vegetable Toughness*: Though a cactus does possess vital organs, they are not nearly as vulnerable as a human or vodyanoi's, buried as they are beneath thick, sinewy, plant-like flesh. A cactacae therefore reduces any Critical Injury result they suffer by 20, to a minimum of 01.

*Regrowth*: Not only are they tough, but cactacae are also fast-healing. A full night's sleep recovers an additional wound (two instead of one by default).

### Garuda

One of the most uncommon minority races in the city, the New Crobuzon's garuda are mostly confined to abject poverty in Spatters, though the university has seen one or two Garuda students over the last few decades, presumably from less deprived communities. In the Cymek, a garuda lives out a brutal but egalitarian existance as part of a nomadic hunting tribe, organised communistically, with no state, money or private property. A Cymek garuda stands tall - a proud hunter - a swing span of some twelve feet (doubling its height), sharp eyes and sharper claws. A garuda in New Crobuzon is no different, at least physically, but their participation in the wage-slavery and poverty of city make them quite a different individal. The garuada community of Spatters is hierarchical and distrustful, though one can hardly blame them in such a dangerous part of the city.

**Brawn: 2**

**Cunning: 1**

**Willpower: 2**

**Presence: 2**

*Starting Wound Threshold*: 10 + Brawn

*Starting Strain Threshold*: 10 + Willpower

*Starting Experience*: 80

*Starting Skills*: A garuda gains one rank in Perception. A garuda's senses are much improved on a human's, and they are therefore often learn to use this to their advantage in the city.

*Talons*: garuda possess sharp talons. When making an unarmed combat check, a garuda adds +1 to their base damage and have a Critical Rating of 3.

*Flight*: With a wingspan approximately doubling their height, and feathers to lighten their imposing size, a garuda can fly high above the towers of the city. A garuda should therefore ignore otherwise impassable or difficult terrain when flying, and can move from long range to short range using a single maneuvre if they start their flight from a great height or otherwise good conditions. Players may want to consider spending a Story Point to induce such conditions, such as a sudden gust of wind, allowing their garuda a burst of speed.

*A Hunter's Sense*: whilst those garuda living in the city may not use it for the same purpose as those indiviuals from the Cymek, all garuda are nevertheless possessed of senses that go beyond the ordinary - sight and hearing as well as reflexes. Once per session, a garuda may choose to enter a trance - known as yajhu-saak, the hunter's reverie, in the Cymek. Their breathing slows; they become utterly calm, and they may upgrade any one Vigilance or Perception check. Within a structured encouter (i.e. combat), this ability counts as a manoeuvre and lasts for the during of the player's turn. In narrative play, the trance lasts for up to four hours, with the upgraded check being made in this period.

If the garuda was taught yajhu-saak formally as part of a Cymek tribe, the player may spend an additional 5xp from their starting experience to have this ability heal 3 strain upon its use.

### Humans

The human is a bipedal creature, resembling an upright, hairless ape. On average, humans are five and a half foot tall approximately, though both height and weight can vary significantly. In New Crobuzon, they are the majority of the population, with approximately 73% of the some three million Crobuzoners being human. As with the other races of New Crobuzon, there is no monolithic 'human culture', but many overlapping cultures and histories refracted through the city's own history. This is especially true for humans, which can be found across the whole continent of Rohagi. A different story might be told by some - perhaps a Quiller or Fat Sun supporter - that the culture of the city and the nation is the culture of humans, a culture which dominates by right. They are wrong, partly - there is nothing natural or Jabber-ordained in the domination of human over xenian - but that domination does exist, in various forms. From the xenian ghettos to the power of the industrialists, almost all human, the xenian is, in many ways, second class.

---

### Khepri

There have been khepri in New Crobuzon for some seven-hundred years, ever since the first band of khepri crossed the Swollen Ocean from Bered Kai Nev. The majority of the city's khepri however, came to escape the Ravening. An unknown catastophe, purposefully forgotten by the ancestors of today's khepri, the Ravening drove thousands of khepri on refugee ships to the city - a hundred years ago they crawled, barely afloat, into Iron Bay. Their enormous clockwork motors were rusted and broken, their sails ragged. They were charnel ships, packed with khepri who were only just alive. This influx saw the birth of the khepri ghettos that we see today - Kinken and Creekside. Today, they make up some 8% of New Crobuzon's population.

Unlike the other races in the city, the sexual dimophism of khepri is absolute. The females are sapient, with a bipedal form. They are strikingly similar to the human woman but for their heads. The female head consists of a 2-foot-long headscarab which resembles an enormous beetle, complete with wiggling legs; fragile, useless wings beneath powerful casings; mandibles; antennae; and compound eyes. Their mouthparts cannot communicate in Ragamoll or any other spoken language, and khepri therefore are forced to communicate with other races via sign language or written notes. Among themselves, the khepri converse by scent and complex chemical gusts which other races can smell and taste, but cannot understand. Male khepri are small, insectile and essentially mindless - 2-foot-long scuttling things unable to do more than feed and reproduce which, for female khepri, is an unpleasant chore. Sex between females is common, though highly ritualised in some communities; in more liberal ones 'pleasuresex' bares more resemblance to sex among humans.

**Brawn: 2**

**Cunning: 2**

**Willpower: 2**

**Presence: 1**

*Starting Wound Threshold*: 10 + Brawn

*Starting Strain Threshold*: 10 + Willpower

*Starting Experience*: 95

*Starting Skills*: A khepri starts with one rank in Survival, reflecting the culural history of the race in New Crobuzon.

*Insectile Vision*: A khepri's sight is very different to that of a human or vodyanoi. Due to their buldging insect-like eyes, a khepri's view is more panoramic and colourful. Their sense of smell is also much greater than a human's. Khepri are therefore much less troubled by vision impairing effects, and two setback die should be removed from any Perception or Vigilence checks that would otherwise have been affected by concealment such as smoke or darkness.

*Non-Verbal*: Khepri communicate both language and emotion using scented excretions. Individuals who are close to khepri may become familiar with scents communicating fear or love or annoyance, but beyond that, khepri must either use sign language or written notes. Whilst there are no strict mechanical rules here, players should be aware that, in structured encounters especially, khepri cannot shout to an ally to provide assistance, for example.

### Remade

The Remade are not a 'race' as such. They are not an accidential creation of mutation and evolutionary law, but an intentional creation of New Crobuzon's state machine. A convicted criminal is 'remade' by expert biothaumaturges in the city's punishment factories. Their form is twisted, parts added and ripped away, until the remaking meets the court's instruction. Either the remaking seeks to make poetic commentary on the crime - theives melded with the items they stole; political dissidents with mouths disappeared - or the court will order a remaking for the purpose of hard labour - criminals fused with coal furnaces and their arms replaced with tools. The victims of this process must often relearn basic activities like walking, speaking, and other simple physical acts in their new bodies.

A Remade is a pariah who is both legally and politically oppressed. No upright citizen of the middle class loves a criminal, and the default assumption of most New Crobuzoners is that a remade is a political extremist, a violent thug, and possibly a traitor to the city. Even among the city’s less fortunate, the Remade are often viewed with suspicion. Inside the city, Remade make up some 2% of the population. Outside of the city, small bands of fReemade have escaped from captivity and servitude in New Crobuzon and live as bandits, free from this stigma. Even there though, the taboo against the Remade means that few of the fReemade add to their remakings.

**Brawn: 1**

**Agility: 1**

**Intellect: 1**

**Cunning: 1**

**Willpower: 1**

**Presence: 1**

*Starting Wound Threshold*: 10 + Brawn

*Starting Strain Threshold*: 10 + Willpower

*Starting Experience*: 215

*Starting Skills*: A Remade starts with one rank in Resilience or Discipline, reflecting the mental and physical strength necessary to survive a remaking.

*Second-Class Citizen*: The Remade in New Crobuzon are sometimes feared, often mistrusted, and almost always treated as fundamentally different from other citizens of the city. Remade add a setback die to Charm, Deception and Negotiation checks, but add boost die to Coercion checks. This does not apply when interacting with those comfortable or familiar with Remade. 

*Amalgamation*: Since the effects of a remaking can be so vastly different, players who choose to create and play as a Remade character must consider a few things. First, since many Remade have innorganic or industrial parts, a Mechanics check may be used instead of a Medicine check, depending on where, narratively, the character has been injured. For example, an injury to a coal engine fused to the back of a PC will require a Mechanics check to 'heal', whereas an injury to the fleshy arm of the same PC will require a Medicine check.

Second, when a player is creating a Remade, they should consider whether their starting equipment is part of their remaking and, if not, players should make sure that the remaking is not so disabling that their Remade character cannot carry weapons or wear armour.

Third, although adding to a remaking in New Crobuzon is both difficult, expsenive and taboo amongst Remade, it is possible. With the right connections - either established through a hard Knowledge (City) check or decided narratively by the GM - a Remade character can augment themselves. Players may wish to permantly meld a piece of equipment to their character (ignoring encumberance), and/or use the rules for cybernetic implants described on p.177 of the *Genesys Core Rulebook* (the implants' flavour adapted to the setting).

---

### Vodyanoi

Second only to humans in number, the amphibious, frog-like vodyanoi represent a full 10% of the city's population. Vodyanoi faces are similar to those of humans or cactcae but their large hands and feet are lightly webbed. Their fingers are nimble. The vodyanoi seem smaller than they truly are because of their hunched and squatting posture and their lack of neck, and they rarely seem to stand much more than 4 feet high. Their true size is apparent from their weight, however, as most tip the scales at more than 170 pounds, and the fattest among them weigh 300 pounds or more.

Unlike some xenian races, vodyanoi can be found, in some number, among the middle and upper classes, with some boasting large manors partly submerged beneath water. The mass of vodyanoi though, as with the population as a whole, are workers, with a vast number working in the city's docks.

*Starting Experience*: 90

*Starting Skills*: A vodyanoi starts with one rank in Coordination.

*Water-Dweller*: Happiest in water, a vodyanoi’s good health depends on their ability to maintain the natural moisture of their skin. Taking a natural rest requires a vodyanoi to bathe themself, else they will not heal any wounds. Each day without bathing, the vodyanoi will suffer a wound. 

*Amphibious*: Vodyanoi can breathe underwater without penalty and do not suffer movement penalties for travelling through water.

*Watercraeft*: A vodyanoi possess the strange ability to hand-mould water to suit their needs. Watercraefted objects may last indefinitely if in contact with a vodyanoi. Out of vodyanoi hands though, even if handled carefully, an object will return to its natural form after around an hour. A vodyanoi may create a simple object (e.g. a ball or a small figurine) or change the flow of a small stream without a skill check, but must make a hard Coordination check to create an object with any complexity or firmness (e.g. a key or a shovel) or change the course of a river.

### Wyrmen

Wyrmen are aerial clowns and messengers in the skies of New Crobuzon. They are a stupid but genial race, happy to serve, happy to fart, and happy to frown and laugh as the mood takes them. In new Crobuzon, they are often messengers, couriers, and spies for anyone who will pay a good sum. They nest under eaves and on rooftops near the warmth of chimneys, or in abandoned tenements and warehouses with easy access to the sky. Wyrmen speak Ragamoll badly, but they know all the choice curse words. Their children are named with seemingly random words - Bottlecap, Buggerme, and Teafortwo. Physically, wyrmen are red-skinned, four-limbed creatures with two leathery wings and two feet. Their feet function as hands and they rarely walk anywhere. They stand about 3 feet tall at most (although they frequently slouch,) and weigh no more than 60 pounds.

*Small*: Wyrmen are silhoutte 0.

*Flight*: With their bat-like wings, a wyrman can saw across the city, catching currents on the air and looping over the city's skyrail and under its rail bridges. They can also hover a little off the ground, bobbing up and down with the effort of each flap. As such, a wyrman should ignore otherwise impassable or difficult terrain, and can move from long range to short range using a single maneuvre if they start their flight from a great height or otherwise good conditions. Players may want to consider spending a Story Point to induce such conditions, such as a sudden gust of wind, allowing their wyrman a burst of speed.

## Careers

When creating a character in the setting of New Crobuzon, players may use any of the role-based careers listed in the *Genesys Core Rulebook* (pp.40-42), whilst, of course, making them appropriate for the world. They are: **Entertainer**, **Explorer**, **Healer**, **Leader**, **Scoundrel**, **Socialte**, **Soldier** and **Tradesperson**. The following section gives details the careers found in that rulebook - Leader and Soldier - that I felt benefitted from renaming and re-describing. These are now **Renegade** and **Survivor**. Then follows two original careers - **Thinker** and **Thaumaturge**. Where appropriate, I have put the coresponding name of the career given by the *Genesys Core Rulebook* in brackets.

---

### Renegade (Leader)

Wherever there is authority, there are dissidents. This is true from the schoolmaster's office, to the factory, to the city-state, and it is most certainly true in New Crobuzon. With unseen militiamen on every corner, lackeys of the industrialist in every workplace, and reactionary gangs of Quillers roving xenian districts after dark, resistence is a means of survival for many. There are organised radicals of course, those groupings around that illegal newsheet *Runagate Rampate* - its readers, its writers, its distributors, its agitators. There are also more loose sets of affiliations - friends and comrades organising their workplaces, passing on whispers of strikes and calls for demonstrations. To be a renegade in New Crobuzon, an individual must be wary, but there must also be charismatic, confident, disciplined - how else to *organise*? They must be tough-talking at times, and ready to draw a knife if the situation requires.  

The Renegade counts the following skills as career skills: Charm, Coercion, Cool, Discipline, Leadership, Melee, Negotiation, and Perception. Before spending experience during character creation, a Renegade may choose four of their career skills and gain one rank in each of them.

---

### Survivor (Soldier)

New Crobuzon can be a harsh place and, though it has not seen war in many decades, it is not a place lacking in violence. Physical force is a threat of the state and of criminal gangs certainly, but not all strength in the city is oppressive. Many Crobuzoners depend on strength to feed themselves and their families, whether in the factory, at the docks, or in that legendary glad' circus - the fighting pits of *Cadnebar's*. Nor is the city short in hired muscle should someone require it. Whatever the occupation though, such physical labour makes for a hardy individual.  

The Survivor counts the following skills as career skills: Athletics, Brawl, Coercion, Melee, Perception, Ranged, Survival, and Vigilance. Before spending experience during character creation, a Survivor may choose four of their career skills and gain one rank in each of them.

---

### Thinker

The majority of the citizens of New Crobuzon earn their keep by the selling of their labour power, either to a wealthy industrialist, or directly to the public by their own small business, but not all these individuals sell their ability to perform *physical* labour. New Crobuzon needs lifters, builders, and shifters of all kinds to maintain itself, but it also needs thinkers. New Crubozon University is surely the largest single organisation of thinkers and scholars in the city - its high-paid professors as well as its overworked research assistants - but this kind of individual can be found across New Crobuzon. Parliament maintains a large research and development department where the latest thaumaturgic and scientific advancements are made to serve the interests of the state, and Brock Marsh  - the city's Scientific Quarter - houses all manner of physicists, biophilosophers and teratologists, chymists, necrochymists and mathematicians, all plying their trade from warehouses and shopfronts (alongside as many of their thaumaturge cousins). This is not to mention, of course, all the less exciting professions of the 'intellectual' worker - the city's secretaries, clerks and scriveners.

The Thinker counts the following skills as career skills: Charm, Deception, Knoweldge (Lore), Knowledge (Science), Knowledge (World), Knowledge (Xenology), Negotiation and Perception. Before spending experience during character creation, a Thinker may choose four of their career skills and gain one rank in each of them.

---

### Thaumaturge

The practicioners of that combination of science and fairytale magic we call 'thaumaturgy' are the city's thaumaturges. Beyond the simple hexes of the first-year university student or the amateur street-performer, a thaumaturge is a trained professional in their craft. Thaumaturges can be found all across New Crobuzon, and indeed Bas-Lag (though their magics become less and less recognisable the further afield one goes). Probably the most well-known gathering of thaumaturges in New Croubzon though is in the city's Scientific Quarter - Brock Marsh. There, badgers, familiars by tradition, waddle between warehouses and shopfronts, ferrying chymical-thaumaturgic compounds from scientist to thaumaturge and back. When a thaumaturgic errand needs doing, a citizen will more often than not make for Brock Marsh, and they will, more often than not, find what they need. Despite its relatively day-to-day usage and the prevalance of its practicioners, thaumaturgy is a powerful tool. The state therefore has keen interest in it, and you will find many thaumaturges in labs and workshops in the warren of Parliament, as well as in the militia, who employ thaumaturgic abilities for offensive as well as surveillance purposes.

There are a huge variety of thaumaturges, but most are specialised, generally as part of their occupation. They are biothaumaturges, karcists, golemists etc. Whilst some will possess knowledge of other styles and traditions, and of theories of thaumaturgy more generally, very few will master multiple disciplines. For a description of the various disciplines of thaumaturgy, see the (thaumaturgy)[thaumaturgy] section within the setting chapter of this guide.

The Thaumaturge counts the following skills as career skills: Coordination, Discipline, Leadership, Perception, Knowledge (Science), Skullduggery, Vigilance and *one* of the three thaumaturgic skills. Before spending experience during character creation, a Thaumaturge may choose four of their career skills and gain one rank in each of them.

---

## Skills

The New Crobuzon setting uses a set of all-setting skills, with the exception of its thaumaturgic skills, which diverge from the three magic skills provided in the *Core Rulebook*, and its knowledge skills. With the exception of these latter two, players can refer the *Core Rulebook* on how and when to make skill checks using these skills. It should be noted that the absence of a Computers skill (or similar), which may seem a reasonable inclusion due to the prevalance of constructs in the city, has been left out. This is due to the nature of the city's constructs, which are generally mechanical, and all construct-related checks should use the Mechanics skill, though some constructs are highly complex, and the difficulty rating should reflect this if a PC is attempting to alter or repair one.

---

### General Skills

The New Crobuzon setting uses the following general skills: Athletics, Cool, Coordination, Discipline, Driving, Mechanics, Medicine, Operating, Percpetion, Resilience, Skullduggery, Stealth, Streetwise, Survival and Vigiliance.

---

### Combat Skills

The New Crobuzon setting uses the following combat skills: Brawl, Melee (Light), Melee (Heavy) and Ranged.

---

### Social Skills

The New Crobuzon setting uses the following social skills: Charm, Coercion, Deception, Leadership and Negotiation.

---

### Knowledge Skills

The New Crobuzon setting uses the following knowledge skills: City, World, Lore, Underworld, Science, Xenology.

The City and World knowledge skills refer to knowledge of place, one often gained by travel and experience. The Lore skill indicates knowledge of places and times where a PC has not, or cannot, travel - mythical lands, times long past, empires long dead. Underworld is the knowledge of the city's criminal element. Science is the theoretical knowledge of the city's sciences and, at the GMs discretion, thaumaturgy. The Xenology knowledge skill represents the PCs understanding of non-human species' and races' biology, culture and history.

---

### Thaumaturgic Skills

While anyone can learn a simple hex or two, real thaumaturgy requires training. What kind of training the thaumaturge receives - in what way they learns and practise their craft - makes all the difference when it comes to the nature of their abilities. A militia-desserter, once a captain-thaumaturge, able to shoot bolts of glowing unlight from his fingers to strike down enemies of the state, will possess an alltogether different skillset to a chromathaumurge tradesperson, crafting and selling beautiful, glowing baubles at Aspic Bazaar. This is not to say that the latter could not move their hands in such a way to blind a man for life, or that the former could not create a strange shifting, crackling trinket which might sell just as well in Aspic Bazaar, but that the skills of the two thaumaturges are bascially different. One has learnt in the workshop, the other in the barracks. The following skills represent that difference, whilst also representing the basic, shared ability of thaumaturges to attack, to augment objects to and to protect themselves using their craft, though in a million varied ways.

When investing points into any thaumaturgic skill, a player should have in mind what specific discipline of thaumaturgy their character is narratively proficient in. Did they take a class in introductory biothaumaturgy before their expulsion from New Crobuzon University? Or did they learn a little somaturgy from a golemist street performer? Whilst this will not make specific mechanical gameplay differences, since the thaumaturgic abilities available to PCs are defined by what skills they have invested in, both GMs and PCs should have an understanding of the flavour of these abilities. For example, a biothaumaturge scholar with one point invested in the Thaumaturgy (Intellectual) skill will attack a combatant in a very different way to an amateur scientist and meteoromance with one point in the same skill. Though the two will roll the same dice to make an attack, the flavour of such an attack might be very different - the former, perhaps, plunging his hands through the skin of the enemy in an attempt to rearrange their organs, the latter displacing the air around an adversary's mouth and nose to prevent them from breathing. For a description of the various disciplines of thaumaturgy, see the [thaumaturgy](thaumaturgy) section within the setting chapter of this guide.

Due to the necessary aspect of specialisation when learning thaumaturgy, **no PC can have skill points in more than *one* thaumaturgic skill** unless agreed with the GM for story reasons (i.e. the PC goes through particular training over the course of the campaign).

Due to the training required to become an advanced user in a particular thaumaturgic craft, **no PC who does not have the Thaumaturge career can have more than *one* point in *any* thaumaturgic skill** unless agreed with the GM for story reasons (i.e. the PC goes through particular training over the course of the campaign).

For casting the spells found in the *Genesys Core Rulebook*, players may disregard anything reading 'Arcane/Primal/Divine only' (for example, in both tables on p.216) and assume that these feats are possible, as long as they are not contradicted by this guide, and so long as the player has a sufficent in-game description of the action that is in-keeping with the flavour of their thaumaturgic abilities. For inspiration, players may wish to read Scott Zumwalt's [*A Beginner's Guide to Genesys Magic*](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/294931/Zynnythryxs-Guide-to-Magic-A-Beginners-Guide-to-Genesys-Magic).

#### Artisanal (Agility)

For many, thaumaturgy is not an theoretical science, or a weapon, but a craft. The geoempath's ability to sense subterranean formations as part of a mining operation, and the geothaumaturge's ability to turn rock to slurry in order to carry out that operation, is no abstract pursuit, but a part of their work. So too with many of the petit-bourgeois artisans of Brock Marsh, selling their thaumaturgic services to the public. Often, the use of thaumaturgy in this manner is a careful blend of coordination of both the body and mind, and training will involve practice rather than study. Such thaumaturgy might be better compared to blacksmithing or stoneworking rather than the wizardry of fairytales.

The **Artisianal thaumaturgic skill uses the Agility characteristic**, reflecting the often physical nature of the training and practice of the user's craft.

A PC with at least one point in this skill gains access to the following spells: Attack, Augment, Barrier, Curse, Heal and Utility.

---

#### Intellectual (Intellect)

Charged thaumaturgeons are a strange phenomenon. They can unleash destruction, and they can heal; they can be bent to the will of an individual who can focus her mind and channel that focus into changing reality. All this is to say that, to a scholar, thaumaturgy is an excellent subject of study. But it is not only the scholars of New Crobuzon University who take thaumaturgy to be an intellectual endeavour however, though its lecture halls and libraries are filled with students who take precisely this approach. Many of Parliament's thaumaturges, or at least those not part of the militia, take a more abstract, rational view - designing and testing engines and weapons for New Crobuzon's navy and militia. Outside of the city's more official institutions, the Scientific Quarter of Brock Marsh houses many scientist-thaumaturges and thaumaturge-scientists, experimenting with untested thaumaturgic methods and exploring theories of weird phenomena, all of whom take the use and study of thaumaturgy as a careful intellectual pursuit.

The **Intellectual thaumaturgic skill uses the Intellect characteristic**, reflecting the rigourous study and formal training that this kind of individual has completed to learn their art.

A PC with at least one point in this skill gains access to the following spells: Attack, Conjure, Curse, Dispel, Heal and Utility.

---

#### Martial (Willpower)

In the right hands, thaumaturgy can be a powerful destructive force, and an excellent means of self-defense. For those who have learnt thaumaturgy in a certain setting, this is their primary focus. Thaumaturgy is learnt for combat across the city, whether for the means of oppression in the case of the militia, liberation in the case of political rebels, or simple survival in the case of a khepri walking past a Quiller gang after dark. After all, a would-be Quiller harasser may become less than confident should that khepri begin to form sparks of crackling unlight from her fingers.

The **Martial thaumaturgic skill uses the Willpower characteristic**, as a reflection of the necessity that the user should remain displined and focussed in high-pressure, combat or near-combat situations, and the fact that this will have been the focus of their thaumaturgic training.

A PC with at least one point in this skill gains access to the following spells: Attack, Augment, Conjure, Curse, Heal and Utility.

The New Crobuzon setting permits players to buy any talent listed in the *Genesys Core Rulebook*, *Expanded Player's Guide* or *Realms of Terrinoth* (these are collected by community member Drainsmith in their excellent *Talent Tome*, found [here](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/raqr7usuzwizglm/AACsYe6LVU_-f372tRG6vxtya?dl=0&lst=)).

There are two points to consider when choosing a talent, however.

First, does it fit the flavour of the setting and the character? If you are unsure, consult your fellow players and GM. They can even help you rename and change the flavour of the talent if necessary, although changing the mechanics or balance of the talent is not advised. (If your group comes up with any particularly good New Crobuzon versions of offical talents, message me and I will consider adding them to this guide - I can be found on the [Genesys RPG Community Discord Server](https://discord.gg/Y9xM67uttc).)

Second, does the talent refer to a skill or mechanic that is not used in the New Crobuzon setting (e.g. Computers)? If so, this talent has no effect. Talents that refer to 'magic skills' instead refer to thaumaturgic skills, again assuming they are in keeping with the setting.

Setting-specific talents are below:

---

*Lesser Puissant Weapon*

**Tier**: 2

**Activation**: Active

**Ranked**: Yes

If you have any ranks in a thaumaturgic skill that has access to Augment, upon purchasing this talent, you may imbue your weapon with a weird thaumaturgic property. Add a weapon quality to a weapon of your choice that it does not currently have. You may choose from: Accurate, Defensive, Deflection, Disorient, Ensnare, Guided, Knockdown, Reinforced, Stun.

---

*Greater Puissant Weapon*

**Tier**: 3

**Activation**: Active

**Ranked**: No

If you have any ranks in a thaumaturgic skill that has access to Augment, upon purchasing this talent, you may imbue your weapon with a weird thaumaturgic property. Add a weapon quality to a weapon of your choice that it does not currently have. You may choose from: Blast, Burn, Pierce, Reinforced, or Vicious.

## Items and Equipment

### Weapons and Armour

New Crobuzon is not the most welcoming city in Bas-Lag. Any adventurer, dissident, or criminal would do well to arm themselves, and even ordinary citizens may carry a knife for self-defence. Given this, the militia cannot arrest every pistol-wearer and reevebow-weilding cactacae, though they may well wish to keep tabs on those who appear more heavily armed. No doubt a fire-thrower would attract unwanted attention.

Most weapons are illegal to *sell* in the city, but that does not stop New Crobuzon's criminal element from turning a profit. The black market exists throughout in every district, and even a respectable citizen is never too far from the right contact. Black market-only weapons and armour are marked 'R' for 'restricted'.

Below are some weapons that may benefit from further descrption.

---

*Flintlock*

The flintlock is the ubiquitous weapon of New Crobuzon. Be it the rare uniformed officer with his rifle, or the rich citizen waving a pistol from his window at a would-be burgular; the crime boss' lackey, or the vodyanoi whose return journey from the docks takes him everday through dangerous Sheck streets - a flinklock is never far from reach. They are mostly inaccurate weapons, and require regular refilling of black powder, generally carried in a powder horn or case. However, should the small metal ball connect with its fleshy target, it can easily be deadly.

A much rarer type than the simple pistol or rifle flintlocks is the target-rifle. Reserved only for the highly trained militia and other aggressive state actors who require a more precise method of death, the target-rifle is built for accuracy and lethality. Though the technology of the weapon is, in many ways, the same powder-based design of the ordinary flintlock, it is a difficult to aquire weaopn, even for the well-connected criminal.

---

*Iron Riot Shield*

Should the militia require the heavier touch - the putting-down of a strike, or the arrest of a well-known dissident - onlookers will doubtless see armoured militiamen with their large iron riot shields. The eyes of the man behind it stare through the reinforced glass window of the shield at the amassing picket. The iron of the shield will withstand much, and, indeed, is capable of dealing out its own share of brutality.

---

*Puissant Weaponry*

As in industry, chymistry and art, thaumaturgy can be used to augment and enhance weaponry, lending whatever knife, pistol or bomb certain otherwise inexplicable capacities. Whisper soft words to your gun and it will cough out globules of too-large bullet metal, sticking to and burning through its target rather than leaving the usual bullet hole; your sword spits crackling thaumaturgic unlight as it cuts through flesh like a serrated elytric saw. A thaumaturge is needed for such enhancements of course, whether the weapon's user is the augmenter, or whether she has been lucky enough to find such a one in the Scientific Quarter of Brock Marsh.

Refer to the above section on Talents to see how a player character may create a pussiant weapon. Otherwise, GM's should take care when introducing a vendor capable of producing such a weapon as part of a story beat; particularly the 'greater' variety, which can be very powerful.

---

*Rivebow*

The designers of the first rivebow had been human. The weapons had been used during the ghastly premiership of Mayor Collodd - they had been carried by the human guards of the mayor’s cactus farm. But after the reforming Sapience Bill dissolved the farm and granted cactacae something approaching citizenship, the pragmatic cactus elders had realized this would be an invaluable weapon to keep their own people in line. Since then, the bow has been improved many times, this time by cactacae engineers.

The rivebow is an enormous crossbow, too large and heavy for a human effectively to operate. It fires not bolts, but chakris; flat metal disks with serrated or razored edges, or metal stars with curved arms. A toothed hole in the chakri’s centre slots neatly onto a little bud of metal that emerges from the rivebow shaft. When the trigger is pulled, the wire in the shaft snaps violently to, pulling the metal bud at massive speed, intricate gears grinding together to send it spinning at an enormous rate. At the end of the enclosed channel the whirling bolt slips sharply down and out from the chakri’s hole, and the chakri is discharged as fast as a slingshot stone, spinning like the blade of a circular saw.

---

*Stingbox*

A strange metaclockwork weapon of khepri design, the 'stingbox', as humans have christened it, resembles a squared-off wooden block the size of a small bag, with a handle at one end and two short whip-like flails at the other. These are extendable however, and, by the user, are whirled at speed assisted by internal gears. They are then whipped out to catch, pierce and grip the flesh of even an armoured enemy, and at a maximum of twenty feet. A powerful electrical charge is then sent sparking through the line. If death is the aim then the stingbox can deliver, but it can also wound and incapacitate should its user desire. Though a khepri weapon, it is not altogether unimaginable to see a militiaman weilding a stingbox should such rare training be required in defence of the city.

### Gear

*Medicine Pouch*

Wherever one looks, in its industry, streets, drinking establishments, New Crobuzon is a dangerous city, and as such its citizens require medical attention far more than certainly they would like. Those who cannot afford a family doctor must turn to simplier methods and items provided by small businesses scattered throughout most of the city. One such item is the simple medicine pouch containing the basics: perhaps a needle and threat for stitching, simple bandages, a small amount of ointment.

A medicine pouch allows characters to attempt to heal others using Medicine checks without the penalty usually incurred by doing so without medical equipment (the separate penalty for attempting to attend to your own injuries is not affected).

---

*Alleviative Elixir*

Various elixirs with supposedly alleviative properties are sold by small chymists and thaumaturges in the city, particulary, of course, in the Scientific Quarter. Some treat specific ailments, but others act more as simple pain relief and minor assistant to the body's own systems of repair. The worst have body-altering side-effects, but more likely is the elixir that is made lightly addictive by its creator, better for customers to return to *his* shop.

Using an elixir requires one maneuver for your character to apply it either to themself or to another engaged character. The elixir is consumed in the process, and the character immediately heals 5 wounds. While a character can use multiple elixirs, this provides diminishing returns. Each elixir after the first heals one wound
fewer. A second elixir heals 4 wounds, a third heals 3, and so on. Using a sixth elixir in a day has no further effect. After one day, the lingering effects of the elixir wear off, and the character may use elixirs again with their normal effect (this means a character can consume up to five elixir a day, each day).

---

*Toolkit*

To tinker with a construct, a metaclockwork battery, a blasting furnance or a train engine, the tinkerer will require a set of tools. What tools will of course be specific to the task at hand, but a general kit might contain the usual spanners, screwdrivers, hammers, nuts, bolts, nails and perhaps the finer tools asscoiated with the repair or modification of a difference engine, or the analytical engine of a construct.

As well as allowing actions otherwise impossible without tools, a toolkit allows characters to attempt to heal any machine appendages Remade characters may have using Mechanics checks without the penalty usually incurred by doing so without 'medical' equipment (the separate penalty for attempting to attend to your own injuries is not affected).

---

*Carrying Sack*

Easily found in any reasonably stocked market or bazaar, while wearing a carrying sack, your character increases their encumbrance threshold by four.

---

*Lock Pick Set*

With the appropriate criminal contacts, the aspiring thief can aquire a good set of lock picks. Since almost all locks in the city are quite simple, the lock pick can be quite the powerful instrument if one is careful about when and where one decides to break and enter. More secure locks, like those of Parliament, are often far more complex however, or else thaumaturgically sealed. 

When making a Skulduggery check to open a lock or latch, your character adds one automatic success to the results.

---

*Simple Thaumaturgic Aid*

Depending on the kind of thaumaturgic ability employed, the practitioner may find themselves in the need of a simple aid to their hex. This might be any otherwise innocuous item: a small notebook for thaumaturgic calcuations; a weighty granite marble with some small markings; a leather boot turned inside out. In any case, some thaumaturgy requires such an item.

A simple thaumaturgic aid has no mechanical game effects, but any players interested in using thaumaturgy should be encouraged to considering purchasing one as a means to thematically flesh out their particular style (the weirder, more in-keeping with the world, the better) of thaumaturgy.

---

*Thaumaturgic Battery*

Larger or semi-industrial thaumaturgic operations require batteries. These can be of chymico-thaumaturgic or metaclockwork designs, but in whatever case their basic fucntion is the same. The battery holds a certain puissance either generated by the thaumaturge and channelled into the battery, or else generated by complex internal metaclockwork operations initated by the turning of a winch or pulling of a lever. The thaumaturge then iniatates a hex or similar, and the pussiance in the battery assists their cathexic effort; otherwise, a battery may be connected by wire to a thaumaturgic operation not enacted by the thaumaturge herself but by some machinery. A battery might power a difficult piece of communicator thaumaturgy, or else animate a whole flock of golems where only a few would be possible without it.

Once per encounter, a character in the room with (or a short distance from) a battery, may upgrade up to two Ability dice to Proficiency dice on a check using a Thaumaturgic skill. Depending on the battery's size and the magnitude of the task (or any other story-based factors), the GM should indicate how close the battery is to running out. Three uses might be a considered baseline before the battery is expended.

*Shazbah, Very-Tea, Dreamshit*

Shazbah, very-tea and dreamshit, as well as quinner and tusk, represent the most popular recreational drugs used in the city of New Crobuzon. All are found invariably in the opposing worlds of the rich socialites and the exploited underemployed (and the various levels in between), though only in the former is their usage seen as sophisticated, refined, part-of-the-dinner-party. In the latter, drug usage is criminal, and addicts, party-goers and bohemian experimentalists alike risk being picked up by militia while crimelords live comfortably. Of course, minor, more local black market players can also accumulate a modest wealth, or at least more effectively than with a job in the dumps of Griss Twist or elsewhere.

Shazbah is perhaps the most often found drug in the city, though it is far from the least dangerous. It can be snorted or smoked, and gives the user a wide-eyed, twitching awareness which can heighten and intensify pleasure or excitement, but also fear and anxiety. It smells strangely acidic, and gives the user a similar odour.

Drunk in small does, very-tea is a light hallucinogenic that stimulates the visual and olfactory cortexes, and as such provides the user with a pleasing intensification and augmentation of sight and smell, leading to minor hallucination. In larger does, the user appears blackout drunk. Often combined with shazbah for a more adrenaline-fueled experience. 

Dreamshit is a stranger substance. Coming in the form of brown, extremely sticky pellets, and smelling of very burnt sugar, when consumed, dreamshit gives the user an overwhelming mental experience. The feeling is like that of having intensely vivid, rapidly shifting dreams, but the user is unable to break from this all-encompassing 'sleep' for the duration of the drugs effects, which for a small dose can last around half an hour of sweating semi-consciousness. The 'dreams', however, are not of one's own perspective, and the effect is of briefly but deeply entering the lives of others, only to be spat out into another life, and another, and so on. The artists and drug-mystics amongst dreamshit's devotees like to claim that the drug allows the user to directly commune with other minds, but this seems unlikely. Afterward, the drug gives the user the most extruciating hangover, but this fades in around an hour, perhaps partially explaining the drug's popularity despite its very high price.

On the very much lighter end, quinner is a simple downer, sometimes found laced in sweet foods and used in relaxed social settings amongst friends.
